  abstract = "Abstract Latest climate projections suggest that both frequency
              and intensity of climate extremes will be substantially modified
              over the course of the coming decades. As a consequence, we need
              to understand to what extent and via which pathways climate
              extremes affect the state and functionality of terrestrial
              ecosystems and the associated biogeochemical cycles on a global
              scale. So far the impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial
              biosphere were mainly investigated on the basis of case studies,
              while global assessments are widely lacking. In order to
              facilitate global analysis of this kind, we present a
              methodological framework that firstly detects spatiotemporally
              contiguous extremes in Earth observations, and secondly infers
              the likely pathway of the preceding climate anomaly. The approach
              does not require long time series, is computationally fast, and
              easily applicable to a variety of data sets with different
              spatial and temporal resolutions. The key element of our analysis
              strategy is to directly search in the relevant observations for
              spatiotemporally connected components exceeding a certain
              percentile threshold. We also put an emphasis on characterization
              of extreme event distribution, and scrutinize the attribution
              issue. We exemplify the analysis strategy by exploring the
              fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR)
              from 1982 to 2011. Our results suggest that the hot spots of
              extremes in fAPAR lie in Northeastern Brazil, Southeastern
              Australia, Kenya and Tanzania. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
              size distribution of extremes follow a distinct power law. The
              attribution framework reveals that extremes in fAPAR are
              primarily driven by phases of water scarcity.",

              basis for life on land. Earth System Models (ESMs) incorporating
              the interactions of land ecosystems and climate are used to
              predict the future of the terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO .
              ESMs require accurate representation of GPP. However, current
              ESMs disagree on how GPP responds to environmental variations ,
              suggesting a need for a more robust theoretical framework for
              modelling . Here, we focus on a key quantity for GPP, the ratio
              of leaf internal to external CO ($\chi$). $\chi$ is tightly
              regulated and depends on environmental conditions, but is
              represented empirically and incompletely in today's models. We
              show that a simple evolutionary optimality hypothesis predicts
              specific quantitative dependencies of $\chi$ on temperature,
              vapour pressure deficit and elevation; and that these same
              dependencies emerge from an independent analysis of empirical
              $\chi$ values, derived from a worldwide dataset of >3,500 leaf
              stable carbon isotope measurements. A single global equation
              embodying these relationships then unifies the empirical
              light-use efficiency model with the standard model of C
              photosynthesis , and successfully predicts GPP measured at
              eddy-covariance flux sites. This success is notable given the
              equation's simplicity and broad applicability across biomes and
              plant functional types. It provides a theoretical underpinning
              for the analysis of plant functional coordination across species
              and emergent properties of ecosystems, and a potential basis for
              the reformulation of the controls of GPP in next-generation ESMs.",

              responses can be efficiently modelled without recourse to
              empirical models or underlying mechanism. Previous efforts have
              been challenged by the lack of a transparent index for the cost
              of losing water. Yet it is accepted that stomata control water
              loss to avoid excessive loss of hydraulic conductance from
              cavitation and soil drying. Proximity to hydraulic failure and
              desiccation can represent the cost of water loss. If at any given
              instant, the stomatal aperture adjusts to maximize the
              instantaneous difference between photosynthetic gain and
              hydraulic cost, then a model can predict the trajectory of
              stomatal responses to changes in environment across time. Results
              of this optimization model are consistent with the widely used
              Ball-Berry-Leuning empirical model (r > 0.99) across a wide range
              of vapour pressure deficits and ambient CO concentrations for wet
              soil. The advantage of the optimization approach is the absence
              of empirical coefficients, applicability to dry as well as wet
              soil and prediction of plant hydraulic status along with gas
              exchange.",

              twentieth-century trends in drought regimes are ambiguous, across
              many regions more frequent and severe droughts are expected in
              the twenty-first century. Recovery time-how long an ecosystem

  abstract = "Monitoring, understanding and modelling carbon emission and

              stakeholders in the application of mitigation strategies. In this
              study, we use the remote sensing model C-Fix at the local stand
              scale to improve the integration of algorithms for water and
              temperature limitation. These new algorithms are applied to
              estimate net ecosystem productivity in a fully water limited
              mode. Four different C-Fix scenarios (partially and fully water
              limited, partially and fully water limited with temperature
              conversion), to obtain net ecosystem productivity of European
              forests, were compared with \{EUROFLUX\} measurements using
              different statistics. In the first scenario (i) C-Fix is
              partially water limited since the \{NDVI\} is used as indicator
              for the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation
              (fAPAR). The \{NDVI\} depends on plant water availability at the
              long term (months). In the fully water limited C-Fix scenario
              (ii) short-term water availability is included taking into
              account soil moisture content. The third (iii) and fourth (iv)
              scenarios are respectively the partially and fully water limited
              scenarios wherein canopy and soil temperature, derived from the
              atmospheric temperature, are incorporated to account for the
              temperature driven processes of vegetation and soil. The error
              propagation by C-Fix was also analysed. Introducing water
              limitation and converting atmospheric temperature to apparent
              canopy and soil temperatures, significantly improves validation
              results based on \{EUROFLUX\} data. For pooled data, a final
              slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of the linear
              regression between C-Fix and \{EUROFLUX\} \{NEP\} values is 0.86,
              0.09 and 0.64, respectively. When implementing full water
              limitation a reduction of 42\% of the estimated \{NEP\} is
              obtained with respect to partially limited NEP. The error
              propagation by C-Fix for the partially and fully water limited

              based model with potential in regional, continental and global
              dry matter estimations and in carbon uptake/release studies,

              understanding for reliably predicting photosynthetic capacity is
              still missing. To advance this understanding we have tested
              across C(3) plant species the coordination hypothesis, which
              assumes nitrogen allocation to photosynthetic processes such that
              photosynthesis tends to be co-limited by
              ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and regeneration.
              The coordination hypothesis yields an analytical solution to
              predict photosynthetic capacity and calculate area-based leaf
              nitrogen content (N(a)). The resulting model linking leaf
              photosynthesis, stomata conductance and nitrogen investment
              provides testable hypotheses about the physiological regulation
              of these processes. Based on a dataset of 293 observations for 31
              species grown under a range of environmental conditions, we
              confirm the coordination hypothesis: under mean environmental
              conditions experienced by leaves during the preceding month, RuBP
              carboxylation equals RuBP regeneration. We identify three key
              parameters for photosynthetic coordination: specific leaf area
              and two photosynthetic traits (k(3), which modulates N investment
              and is the ratio of RuBP carboxylation/oxygenation capacity
              (V(Cmax)) to leaf photosynthetic N content (N(pa)); and J(fac),
              which modulates photosynthesis for a given k(3) and is the ratio
              of RuBP regeneration capacity (J(max)) to V(Cmax)). With
              species-specific parameter values of SLA, k(3) and J(fac), our
              leaf photosynthesis coordination model accounts for 93\% of the
              total variance in N(a) across species and environmental
              conditions. A calibration by plant functional type of k(3) and
              J(fac) still leads to accurate model prediction of N(a), while
              SLA calibration is essentially required at species level.
              Observed variations in k(3) and J(fac) are partly explained by
              environmental and phylogenetic constraints, while SLA variation
              is partly explained by phylogeny. These results open a new avenue

              predictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard
              depths): soil organic carbon (g kg-1), soil pH, sand, silt and
              clay fractions (\%), bulk density (kg m-3), cation-exchange
              capacity (cmol+/kg), coarse fragments (\%), soil organic carbon
              stock (t ha-1), depth to bedrock (cm), World Reference Base soil
              groups, and USDA Soil Taxonomy suborders. Our predictions are
              based on global spatial prediction models which we fitted, per
              soil variable, using a compilation of major international soil
              profile databases (ca. 110,000 soil profiles), and a selection of
              ca. 75 global environmental covariates representing soil forming
              factors. Results of regression modeling indicate that the most
              useful covariates for modeling soils at the global scale are
              climatic and biomass indices (based on MODIS images), lithology,
              and taxonomic mapping units derived from conventional soil survey
              (Harmonized World Soil Database). Prediction accuracies assessed
              using 5-fold cross-validation were between 23-51\%.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SoilGrids1km provide an initial set of
              examples of soil spatial data for input into global models at a
              resolution and consistency not previously available. Some of the
              main limitations of the current version of SoilGrids1km are: (1)
              weak relationships between soil properties/classes and
              explanatory variables due to scale mismatches, (2) difficulty to
              obtain covariates that capture soil forming factors, (3) low
              sampling density and spatial clustering of soil profile
              locations. However, as the SoilGrids system is highly automated
              and flexible, increasingly accurate predictions can be generated
              as new input data become available. SoilGrids1km are available

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OzFlux is the regional Australian and New Zealand flux tower network that aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess trends, and improve predictions, of Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate. This paper describes the evolution, design and current status of OzFlux as well as an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and found that the response of Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies but that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70 {\%}) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had similar radiation use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances including drought, fire, land use and land cover change, land management and climate change that are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The importance of ecological management for reducing the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change is increasingly recognized, yet frameworks to facilitate a structured approach to climate adaptation management are lacking. We developed a conceptual framework that can guide identification of climate change impacts and adaptive management options in a given region or biome. The framework focuses on potential points of early climate change impact, and organizes these along two main axes. First, it recognizes that climate change can act at a range of ecological scales. Secondly, it emphasizes that outcomes are dependent on two potentially interacting and countervailing forces: (1) changes to environmental parameters and ecological processes brought about by climate change, and (2) responses of component systems as determined by attributes of resistance and resilience. Through this structure, the framework draws together a broad range of ecological concepts, with a novel emphasis on attributes of resistance and resilience that can temper the response of species, ecosystems and landscapes to climate change. We applied the framework to the world's largest remaining Mediterranean-climate woodland, the 'Great Western Woodlands' of south-western Australia. In this relatively intact region, maintaining inherent resistance and resilience by preventing anthropogenic degradation is of highest priority and lowest risk. Limited, higher risk options such as fire management, protection of refugia and translocation of adaptive genes may be justifiable under more extreme change, hence our capacity to predict the extent of change strongly impinges on such management decisions. These conclusions may contrast with similar analyses in degraded landscapes, where natural integrity is already compromised, and existing investment in restoration may facilitate experimentation with higher risk options.},

abstract = {Global carbon balances are increasingly affected by large fluctuations in productivity occurring throughout semiarid regions. Recent analyses found a large C uptake anomaly in 2011 in arid and semiarid regions of the southern hemisphere. Consequently, we compared C and water fluxes of two distinct woody ecosystems (a Mulga (Acacia) woodland and a Corymbia savanna) between August 2012 and August 2014 in semiarid central Australia, demonstrating that the 2011 anomaly was short-lived in both ecosystems. The Mulga woodland was approximately C neutral but with periods of significant uptake within both years. The extreme drought tolerance of Acacia is presumed to have contributed to this. By contrast, the Corymbia savanna was a very large net C source (130 and 200gCm-2yr-1in average and below average rainfall years, respectively), which is likely to have been a consequence of the degradation of standing, senescent biomass that was a legacy of high productivity during the 2011 anomaly. The magnitude and temporal patterns in ecosystem water-use efficiencies (WUE), derived from eddy covariance data, differed across the two sites, which may reflect differences in the relative contributions of respiration to net C fluxes across the two ecosystems. In contrast, differences in leaf-scale measures of WUE, derived from13C stable isotope analyses, were apparent at small spatial scales and may reflect the different rooting strategies of Corymbia and Acacia trees within the Corymbia savanna. Restrictions on root growth and infiltration by a siliceous hardpan located below Acacia, whether in the Mulga woodland or in small Mulga patches of the Corymbia savanna, impedes drainage of water to depth, thereby producing a reservoir for soil moisture storage under Acacia while acting as a barrier to access of groundwater by Corymbia trees in Mulga patches, but not in the open Corymbia savanna.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering a considerable fraction of anthropogenic CO2, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. However, there is a gap in our understanding about the carbon dynamics of eucalypt (broadleaf evergreen) forests in temperate climates, which might differ from temperate evergreen coniferous or deciduous broadleaved forests given their fundamental differences in physiology, phenology and growth dynamics. To address this gap we undertook a 3-year study (2010–2012) of eddy covariance measurements in a dry temperate eucalypt forest in southeastern Australia. We determined the annual net carbon balance and investigated the temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability in and environmental controls of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). The forest was a large and constant carbon sink throughout the study period, even in winter, with an overall mean NEE of −1234 ± 109 (SE) g C m−2 yr−1. Estimated annual ER was similar for 2010 and 2011 but decreased in 2012 ranging from 1603 to 1346 g C m−2 yr−1, whereas GPP showed no significant inter-annual variability, with a mean annual estimate of 2728 ± 39 g C m−2 yr−1. All ecosystem carbon fluxes had a pronounced seasonality, with GPP being greatest during spring and summer and ER being highest during summer, whereas peaks in NEE occurred in early spring and again in summer. High NEE in spring was likely caused by a delayed increase in ER due to low temperatures. A strong seasonal pattern in environmental controls of daytime and night-time NEE was revealed. Daytime NEE was equally explained by incoming solar radiation and air temperature, whereas air temperature was the main environmental driver of night-time NEE. The forest experienced unusual above-average annual rainfall during the first 2 years of this 3-year period so that soil water content remained relatively high and the forest was not water limited. Our results show the potential of temperate eucalypt forests to sequester large amounts of carbon when not water limited. However, further studies using bottom-up approaches are needed to validate measurements from the eddy covariance flux tower and to account for a possible underestimation in ER due to advection fluxes.},

abstract = {Old-growth forests can accumulate carbon. However, what controls the rate of net carbon accumulation in those old-growth forests is still poorly understood. Using eddy flux measurements from two old-growth evergreen broadleaf forests (subtropical forest and tropical forest) in southern China, we compared the seasonal and inter-annual variations in the carbon fluxes of those two forests and quantified the major drivers for these temporal variations. The measured flux data showed that the annual net carbon uptake of the subtropical forest was generally much larger than that for the tropical forest. The mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over 6 years was -397±94gCm-2yr-1for the subtropical forest and -166±49gCm-2yr-1for the tropical forest with different seasonal variations. The subtropical forest was a carbon sink for most months in a year, while the tropical forest was a carbon source in wet seasons (positive NEE) and a carbon sink in dry seasons (negative NEE). Both forests were stronger carbon sink in dry years, because of much larger reduction in ER than in wet years. At the seasonal scale, GPP in wet seasons was 37.1{\%} higher than that for dry seasons in the subtropical forest, and was only 12.4{\%} higher in the tropical forest. The amplitude of seasonal GPP variation in the tropical forest was much weaker than in the subtropical forest, but the amplitude of the seasonal variation in ER was much larger than in the subtropical forest. The seasonal variation in NEE was largely driven by the variation in monthly ER of the tropical forest, and by both seasonal variations in monthly GPP and ER of the subtropical forest. At inter-annual scale, annual NEE varied tightly with annual rainfall from year to year. Therefore annual rainfall was suggested a fundamental driver of annual carbon sequestration in the subtropical and tropical forests in southern China. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The behavior of whole ecosystems in humid climate zone in response to drought is less well documented. Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange using the eddy covariance technique during 2003-2007 were made above a subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation in Southeast China. Seasonal distribution of precipitation and temperature was inconsistent during the summer, which resulted in droughts frequently. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem production (NEP) showed clear seasonality, with low rates during droughts and in winter. With statistical significance, the monthly GEP and RE increased exponentially with air temperature, but the monthly NEP was less sensitive and only increased linearly with air temperature. However, the function response of monthly NEP and its components (GEP and RE) disappeared under high temperature and low soil moisture. Monthly and yearly RE showed a statistically linear and positive dependence on the corresponding GEP. Annual NEP varied among years from 306 to 430 g C m(-2) (mean 395, SD 50). Interannual variability in NEP was controlled primarily by air temperature and the ratio of precipitation and evapotranspiration that affected the RE/GEP ratio, which varied between 0.76 and 0.81 (mean 0.78, SD 0.02).},

We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010–2012). Near 95{\%} of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5{\%} at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared {\~{}}50{\%} of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn − G) and H indicated a “cooling effect” feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year. Grazing not only caused an LE shift between the dry and the wet year, but also triggered a decrease in the H/Rn because of changes in vegetation and soil properties, indicating that the ungrazed area had a greater resistance while the grazed area had a greater sensitivity of EB components to the changing climate.},

abstract = {Post-fire salvage logging is a common silvicultural practice around the world, with the potential to alter the regenerative capacity of an ecosystem and thus its role as a source or a sink of carbon. However, there is no information on the effect of burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance. Here, we examine for the first time the effect of post-fire burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance by comparing the carbon exchange of two treatments in a burnt Mediterranean coniferous forest treated by salvage logging (SL, felling and removing the logs and masticating the woody debris) and Non-Intervention (NI, all trees left standing) using eddy covariance measurements. Using different partitioning approaches, we analyze the evolution of photosynthesis and respiration processes together with measurements of vegetation cover and soil respiration and humidity to interpret the differences in the measured fluxes and underlying processes. Results show that SL enhanced CO2emissions of this burnt pine forest by more than 120gCm-2compared to the NI treatment for the period June-December 2009. Although soil respiration was around 30{\%} higher in NI during growing season, this was more than offset by photosynthesis, as corroborated by increases in vegetation cover and evapotranspiration. Since SL is counterproductive to climate-change and Kyoto protocol objectives of optimal C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, less aggressive burnt wood management policies should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

An$\backslash$nupscaling exercise based on the actual land-use map of the surroundings$\backslash$ndemonstrated the importance of including all the major ecosystems in the$\backslash$nlandscape CO2 balance.},

abstract = {Forests in Mediterranean Europe are located in a hot spot for tropospheric ozone formation. We applied two canopy-level stomatal conductance models (Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models) to two Mediterranean evergreen forests (Umbrella pine at San Rossore, and Holm oak at Castelporziano, in central Italy), which is essential for assessing ozone impact on forests via the stomatal flux-based approach. Parameterizations of the models was carried out by the Eddy Covariance technique. Both Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models well explained the observed stomatal conductance and stomatal ozone flux in both forests. Maximum stomatal conductance was 72{\%} higher in Umbrella pine than in Holm oak, leading to higher stomatal ozone flux. Inclusion of a soil water function improved the performance of the Jarvis-type model for the estimation of stomatal ozone flux. We found contrasting results concerning the coefficient m (the slope of the photosynthesis-stomatal conductance relationship) in the Ball-Woodrow-Berry model between the two forests: while m was constant for varying soil water status in the Holm oak forest, it declined with soil drying in the Umbrella pine forest. This may result from higher stomatal sensitivity to drought in Umbrella pine as a response to avoid drought stress. Overall, these results advance our understanding of ozone risk assessment in Mediterranean forests.},
