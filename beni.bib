	Abstract = {Leaf longevity (LL) varies more than 20-fold in tropical evergreen forests, but it remains unclear how to capture these variations using predictive models. Current theories of LL that are based on carbon optimisation principles are challenging to quantitatively assess because of uncertainty across species in the `ageing rate:' the rate at which leaf photosynthetic capacity declines with age. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 49 species across temperate and tropical biomes, demonstrating that the ageing rate of photosynthetic capacity is positively correlated with the mass-based carboxylation rate of mature leaves. We assess an improved trait-driven carbon optimality model with in situLL data for 105 species in two Panamanian forests. We show that our model explains over 40% of the cross-species variation in LL under contrasting light environment. Collectively, our results reveal how variation in LL emerges from carbon optimisation constrained by both leaf structural traits and abiotic environment.},

	Abstract = {



* Drought can cause major damage to plant communities, but species damage thresholds and postdrought recovery of forest productivity are not yet predictable. We used an El Ni{\~n}o drought event as a natural experiment to test whether postdrought recovery of gas exchange could be predicted by properties of the water transport system, or if metabolism, primarily high abscisic acid concentration, might delay recovery.


* We monitored detailed physiological responses, including shoot sapflow, leaf gas exchange, leaf water potential and foliar abscisic acid (ABA), during drought and through the subsequent rehydration period for a sample of eight canopy and understory species.


* Severe drought caused major declines in leaf water potential, elevated foliar ABA concentrations and reduced stomatal conductance and assimilation rates in our eight sample species. Leaf water potential surpassed levels associated with incipient loss of leaf hydraulic conductance in four species. Following heavy rainfall gas exchange in all species, except those trees predicted to have suffered hydraulic impairment, recovered to prestressed rates within 1 d.


* Recovery of plant gas exchange was rapid and could be predicted by the hydraulic safety margin, providing strong support for leaf vulnerability to water deficit as an index of damage under natural drought conditions.

	Abstract = {Abstract Water vapour and carbon dioxide fluxes, as well as environmental factors, were measured in an Eastern Siberian larch forest for 14 years from 1998 to 2011 to understand the water and carbon balances and the effects of environmental variables on these balances in this region. The overstory vegetation in this forest has been damaged by the unusual waterlogging that has occurred since 2005, and the number of living larch decreased by 15% from 1998 to 2011. During this period, the composition of floor vegetation changed from dense cowberry to grasses and shrubs with high water tolerance. This period was categorized into three phases according to annual precipitation: normal years from 1998 to 2000 and from 2009 to 2011, dry years from 2001 to 2004, and wet years from 2005 to 2008. Although the time series of atmospheric conditions were independent of that of annual precipitation, the behaviour of underground conditions such as soil temperature and soil water content followed the change in annual precipitation. The relationships of the evapotranspiration ratio and surface conductance to soil water content from 2007 were different from those prior to 2006, and the group from 2007 was smaller than that prior to 2006 for both relationships. The relationship between gross primary production and soil water content also changed, but this change occurred in 2008. Specifically, the change in characteristics of evapotranspiration preceded that in carbon dioxide by almost one year. The main driver of the interannual variation in water use efficiency was variation in evapotranspiration until 2007 but was variation in gross primary production since 2008. The time lag of the response of evapotranspiration to increased soil water content was nearly two years, whereas it was about three years in the case of gross primary production. Although drought stresses on forests are well known, this is the first report of water and carbon exchanges in Eastern Siberia indicating that the boreal forest has been damaged by wet stresses at the interannual scale. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Latest climate projections suggest that both frequency and intensity of climate extremes will be substantially modified over the course of the coming decades. As a consequence, we need to understand to what extent and via which pathways climate extremes affect the state and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems and the associated biogeochemical cycles on a global scale. So far the impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial biosphere were mainly investigated on the basis of case studies, while global assessments are widely lacking. In order to facilitate global analysis of this kind, we present a methodological framework that firstly detects spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in Earth observations, and secondly infers the likely pathway of the preceding climate anomaly. The approach does not require long time series, is computationally fast, and easily applicable to a variety of data sets with different spatial and temporal resolutions. The key element of our analysis strategy is to directly search in the relevant observations for spatiotemporally connected components exceeding a certain percentile threshold. We also put an emphasis on characterization of extreme event distribution, and scrutinize the attribution issue. We exemplify the analysis strategy by exploring the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) from 1982 to 2011. Our results suggest that the hot spots of extremes in fAPAR lie in Northeastern Brazil, Southeastern Australia, Kenya and Tanzania. Moreover, we demonstrate that the size distribution of extremes follow a distinct power law. The attribution framework reveals that extremes in fAPAR are primarily driven by phases of water scarcity. },

However, current representations vary markedly between TBMs, contributing uncertainty to projections of global carbon fluxes. Here we compared the representation of photosynthesis in seven TBMs by examining leaf and canopy level responses of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) to key environmental variables: light, temperature, CO2 concentration, vapor pressure deficit and soil water content. We identified research areas where limited process knowledge prevents inclusion of physiological phenomena in current TBMs and research areas where data are urgently needed for model parameterization or evaluation. We provide a roadmap for new science needed to improve the representation of photosynthesis in the next generation of terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.},

	Abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 will make Earth warmer, and many studies have inferred that this warming will cause droughts to become more widespread and severe. However, rising atmospheric CO2 also modifies stomatal conductance and plant water use, processes that are often are overlooked in impact analysis. We find that plant physiological responses to CO2 reduce predictions of future drought stress, and that this reduction is captured by using plant-centric rather than atmosphere-centric metrics from Earth system models (ESMs). The atmosphere-centric Palmer Drought Severity Index predicts future increases in drought stress for more than 70% of global land area. This area drops to 37% with the use of precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E), a measure that represents the water flux available to downstream ecosystems and humans. The two metrics yield consistent estimates of increasing stress in regions where precipitation decreases are more robust (southern North America, northeastern South America, and southern Europe). The metrics produce diverging estimates elsewhere, with P-E predicting decreasing stress across temperate Asia and central Africa. The differing sensitivity of drought metrics to radiative and physiological aspects of increasing CO2 partly explains the divergent estimates of future drought reported in recent studies. Further, use of ESM output in offline models may double-count plant feedbacks on relative humidity and other surface variables, leading to overestimates of future stress. The use of drought metrics that account for the response of plant transpiration to changing CO2, including direct use of P-E and soil moisture from ESMs, is needed to reduce uncertainties in future assessment.},

@article{sheffield08,
	Abstract = {Recent and potential future increases in global temperatures are likely to be associated with impacts on the hydrologic cycle, including changes to precipitation and increases in extreme events such as droughts. We analyze changes in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1, A1B and A2 future climate scenarios relative to the PICNTRL pre-industrial control and 20C3M twentieth century simulations from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4. Comparison with observation forced land surface model estimates indicates that the models do reasonably well at replicating our best estimates of twentieth century, large scale drought occurrence, although the frequency of long-term (more than 12-month duration) droughts are over-estimated. Under the future projections, the models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4--6-month duration) droughts from the mid-twentieth century to the end of the twenty-first. Long-term droughts become three times more common. Regionally, the Mediterranean, west African, central Asian and central American regions show large increases most notably for long-term frequencies as do mid-latitude North American regions but with larger variation between scenarios. In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation. Although the predicted future changes in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many regions, they are generally not statistically different from contemporary climate (as estimated from the 1961--1990 period of the 20C3M simulations) or natural variability (as estimated from the PICNTRL simulations) for multiple decades, in contrast to primary climate variables, such as global mean surface air temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, changes in annual and seasonal means of terrestrial hydrologic variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture, are essentially undetectable within the twenty-first century. Changes in the extremes of climate and their hydrological impacts may therefore be more detectable than changes in their means.},

The PRI declined with pre-dawn water potential and a significant relationship between PRI and the xanthophyll de-epoxidation state (DEPS) was observed, although with large interspecific variability in the sensitivity of PRI to changes in DEPS. For single tree species, a strong relationship was observed on either PRI light saturated photosynthesis or PRI maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (ΔF/Fm′); a larger variability in both relationships was apparent when data from different species were pooled together. However, an improved correlation was shown only in the former relationship by plotting the ΔPRI (dawn PRI minus the midday PRI values). Thus, we conclude that PRI is able to provide a good estimate of maximum CO2 assimilation at saturating light and ΔF/Fm′for single tree species, despite the severe drought conditions applied. PRI should be applied more cautiously when dealing with multispecific forests because of confounding factors such as the strong interspecific differences in the initial value of PRI and in the sensitivity of PRI to changes in DEPS in response to drought.},

@article{gamon97,
	Abstract = {The photochemical reflectance index (PRI), derived from narrow-band reflectance at 531 and 570{\thinspace}nm, was explored as an indicator of photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for 20 species representing three functional types: annual, deciduous perennial, and evergreen perennial. Across species, top-canopy leaves in full sun at midday exhibited a strong correlation between PRI and $\Delta$F/Fm{\textasciiacutex}, a fluorescence-based index of photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiency. PRI was also significantly correlated with both net CO2 uptake and radiation use efficiency measured by gas exchange. When species were examined by functional type, evergreens exhibited significantly reduced midday photosynthetic rates relative to annual and deciduous species. This midday reduction was associated with reduced radiation use efficiency, detectable as reduced net CO2 uptake, PRI, and $\Delta$F/Fm{\textasciiacutex} values, and increased levels of the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle pigment zeaxanthin. For each functional type, nutrient deficiency led to reductions in both PRI and $\Delta$F/Fm{\textasciiacutex} relative to fertilized controls. Laboratory experiments exposing leaves to diurnal courses of radiation and simulated midday stomatal closure demonstrated that PRI changed rapidly with both irradiance and leaf physiological state. In these studies, PRI was closely correlated with both $\Delta$F/Fm' and radiation use efficiency determined from gas exchange at all but the lowest light levels. Examination of the difference spectra upon exposure to increasing light levels revealed that the 531{\thinspace}nm $\Delta$ reflectance signal was composed of two spectral components. At low irradiance, this signal was dominated by a 545-nm component, which was not closely related to radiation use efficiency. At progressively higher light levels above 100{\thinspace}$\mu$mol m−2 s−1, the 531-nm signal was increasingly dominated by a 526-nm component, which was correlated with light use efficiency and with the conversion of the xanthophyll pigment violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. Further consideration of the two components composing the 531-nm signal could lead to an index of photosynthetic function applicable over a wide range of illumination. The results of this study support the use of PRI as an interspecific index of photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for leaves and canopies in full sun, but not across wide ranges in illumination from deep shade to full sun. The discovery of a consistent relationship between PRI and photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for top-canopy leaves across species, functional types, and nutrient treatments suggests that relative photosynthetic rates could be derived with the ``view from above'' provided by remote reflectance measurements if issues of canopy and stand structure can be resolved.},

	Abstract = {In evergreen conifers, where the foliage amount changes little with season, accurate detection of the underlying ``photosynthetic phenology'' from satellite remote sensing has been difficult, presenting challenges for global models of ecosystem carbon uptake. Here, we report a close correspondence between seasonally changing foliar pigment levels, expressed as chlorophyll/carotenoid ratios, and evergreen photosynthetic activity, leading to a ``chlorophyll/carotenoid index'' (CCI) that tracks evergreen photosynthesis at multiple spatial scales. When calculated from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite sensor, the CCI closely follows the seasonal patterns of daily gross primary productivity of evergreen conifer stands measured by eddy covariance. This discovery provides a way of monitoring evergreen photosynthetic activity from optical remote sensing, and indicates an important regulatory role for carotenoid pigments in evergreen photosynthesis. Improved methods of monitoring photosynthesis from space can improve our understanding of the global carbon budget in a warming world of changing vegetation phenology.},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) quantifies the amount of atmospheric carbon fixed by plants and accumulated as biomass. Previous studies have shown that climate constraints were relaxing with increasing temperature and solar radiation, allowing an upward trend in NPP from 1982 through 1999. The past decade (2000 to 2009) has been the warmest since instrumental measurements began, which could imply continued increases in NPP; however, our estimates suggest a reduction in the global NPP of 0.55 petagrams of carbon. Large-scale droughts have reduced regional NPP, and a drying trend in the Southern Hemisphere has decreased NPP in that area, counteracting the increased NPP over the Northern Hemisphere. A continued decline in NPP would not only weaken the terrestrial carbon sink, but it would also intensify future competition between food demand and proposed biofuel production.},

	Abstract = {Monitoring, understanding and modelling carbon emission and fixation fluxes are key actions to guide climate change stakeholders in the application of mitigation strategies. In this study, we use the remote sensing model C-Fix at the local stand scale to improve the integration of algorithms for water and temperature limitation. These new algorithms are applied to estimate net ecosystem productivity in a fully water limited mode. Four different C-Fix scenarios (partially and fully water limited, partially and fully water limited with temperature conversion), to obtain net ecosystem productivity of European forests, were compared with \{EUROFLUX\} measurements using different statistics. In the first scenario (i) C-Fix is partially water limited since the \{NDVI\} is used as indicator for the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (fAPAR). The \{NDVI\} depends on plant water availability at the long term (months). In the fully water limited C-Fix scenario (ii) short-term water availability is included taking into account soil moisture content. The third (iii) and fourth (iv) scenarios are respectively the partially and fully water limited scenarios wherein canopy and soil temperature, derived from the atmospheric temperature, are incorporated to account for the temperature driven processes of vegetation and soil. The error propagation by C-Fix was also analysed. Introducing water limitation and converting atmospheric temperature to apparent canopy and soil temperatures, significantly improves validation results based on \{EUROFLUX\} data. For pooled data, a final slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of the linear regression between C-Fix and \{EUROFLUX\} \{NEP\} values is 0.86, 0.09 and 0.64, respectively. When implementing full water limitation a reduction of 42% of the estimated \{NEP\} is obtained with respect to partially limited NEP. The error propagation by C-Fix for the partially and fully water limited cases and when applying temperature buffering, are similar. Respectively, an average daily \{NEP\} of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.4 and 0.40 $\pm$ 0.3 g C m−2 d−1. Due to the combination of simple semi-empirical approaches, inclusion of full water limitation into C-Fix enhances the application field of a remote sensing based model with potential in regional, continental and global dry matter estimations and in carbon uptake/release studies, although a more physically based support is recommended to convert atmospheric temperature to soil and canopy temperature and to estimate fAPAR. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Time-varying crop coefficients (Kc) can be obtained from remotely sensed data and combined with daily potential evapotranspiration estimates for the operational prediction of actual evapotranspiration (ETA). This approach, however, presents relevant limitations when applied in mixed, water stressed ecosystems. The current paper addresses these issues by introducing two innovations. First, fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is derived from \{NDVI\} and utilized to split evaporating and transpiring surfaces, whose behavior is simulated under fully watered conditions by the use of generalized Kc. Next, the short term effect of water shortage is taken into account by means of downregulating factors which are based on meteorological observations (potential evapotranspiration and rainfall) and act differently for vegetated and not vegetated surfaces. The new method is tested against latent heat of evaporation (LE) measurements taken by the eddy covariance technique in six sites of Central Italy representative of various forest and herbaceous ecosystems. In this experiment the method is driven by 1-km meteorological data obtained from a pan-European archive and by 250 m \{MODIS\} \{NDVI\} imagery. Satisfactory accuracies are obtained in all experimental situations, which encourages the application of the method for the operational monitoring of \{ETA\} on regional scale. },

	Abstract = {This paper describes the development and testing of a procedure which combines remotely sensed and ancillary data to monitor forest productivity in Italy. The procedure is based on a straightforward parametric model (C-Fix) that uses the relationship between the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies (fAPAR) and relevant gross primary productivity (GPP). Estimates of forest fAPAR are derived from Spot-VGT \{NDVI\} images and are combined with spatially consistent data layers obtained by the elaboration of ground meteorological measurements. The original version of C-Fix is first applied to estimate monthly \{GPP\} of Italian forests during eight years (1999--2006). Next, a modification of the model is proposed in order to simulate the short-term effect of summer water stress more efficiently. The accuracy of the original and modified C-Fix versions is evaluated by comparison with \{GPP\} data taken at eight Italian eddy covariance flux tower sites. The experimental results confirm the capacity of C-Fix to monitor national forest \{GPP\} patterns and indicate the utility of considering the short-term effect of water stress during Mediterranean dry months. },

@article{sims2008,
	Abstract = {Many current models of ecosystem carbon exchange based on remote sensing, such as the \{MODIS\} product termed MOD17, still require considerable input from ground based meteorological measurements and look up tables based on vegetation type. Since these data are often not available at the same spatial scale as the remote sensing imagery, they can introduce substantial errors into the carbon exchange estimates. Here we present further development of a gross primary production (GPP) model based entirely on remote sensing data. In contrast to an earlier model based only on the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), this model, termed the Temperature and Greenness (TG) model, also includes the land surface temperature (LST) product from MODIS. In addition to its obvious relationship to vegetation temperature, \{LST\} was correlated with vapor pressure deficit and photosynthetically active radiation. Combination of \{EVI\} and \{LST\} in the model substantially improved the correlation between predicted and measured \{GPP\} at 11 eddy correlation flux towers in a wide range of vegetation types across North America. In many cases, the \{TG\} model provided substantially better predictions of \{GPP\} than did the \{MODIS\} \{GPP\} product. However, both models resulted in poor predictions for sparse shrub habitats where solar angle effects on remote sensing indices were large. Although it may be possible to improve the \{MODIS\} \{GPP\} product through improved parameterization, our results suggest that simpler models based entirely on remote sensing can provide equally good predictions of GPP. },

	Abstract = {Accomplishing the objective of the current climate policies will require establishing carbon budget and flux estimates in each region and county of the globe by comparing and reconciling multiple estimates including the observations and the results of top-down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) inversions and bottom-up dynamic global vegetation models. With this in view, this study synthesizes the carbon source/sink due to net ecosystem productivity (NEP), land cover land use change ( E LUC ), fires and fossil burning ( E FIRE ) for the South Asia (SA), Southeast Asia (SEA) and South and Southeast Asia (SSEA = SA + SEA) and each country in these regions using the multiple top-down and bottom-up modeling results. The terrestrial net biome productivity (NBP =NEP -- E LUC -- E FIRE ) calculated based on bottom-up models in combination with E FIRE based on GFED4s data show net carbon sinks of 217 $\pm$ 147, 10 $\pm$ 55, and 227 $\pm$ 279 TgC yr −1 for SA, SEA, and SSEA. The top-down models estimated NBP net carbon sinks were 20 $\pm$ 170, 4 $\pm$ 90 and 24 $\pm$ 180 TgC yr −1 . In comparison, regional emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels were 495, 275, and 770 TgC yr −1 , which are many times higher than the NBP sink estimates, suggesting that the contribution of the fossil fuel emissions to the carbon budget of SSEA results in a significant net carbon source during the 2000s. When considering both NBP and fossil fuel emissions for the individual countries within the regions, Bhutan and Laos were net carbon sinks and rest of the countries were net carbon source during the 2000s. The relative contributions of each of the fluxes (NBP, NEP, E LUC , and E FIRE , fossil fuel emissions) to a nation's net carbon flux varied greatly from country to country, suggesting a heterogeneous dominant carbon fluxes on the country-level throughout SSEA.},

	Abstract = {The terrestrial biosphere absorbs about 20{\%} of fossil-fuel CO2 emissions. The overall magnitude of this sink is constrained by the difference between emissions, the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and the ocean sink. However, the land sink is actually composed of two largely counteracting fluxes that are poorly quantified: fluxes from land-use change and CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems. Dynamic global vegetation model simulations suggest that CO2 emissions from land-use change have been substantially underestimated because processes such as tree harvesting and land clearing from shifting cultivation have not been considered. As the overall terrestrial sink is constrained, a larger net flux as a result of land-use change implies that terrestrial uptake of CO2 is also larger, and that terrestrial ecosystems might have greater potential to sequester carbon in the future. Consequently, reforestation projects and efforts to avoid further deforestation could represent important mitigation pathways, with co-benefits for biodiversity. It is unclear whether a larger land carbon sink can be reconciled with our current understanding of terrestrial carbon cycling. Our possible underestimation of the historical residual terrestrial carbon sink adds further uncertainty to our capacity to predict the future of terrestrial carbon uptake and losses.},

Combining models and observations, Ahlstr{\"o}m et al. found that marginal ecosystems{\textemdash}semiarid savannas and low-latitude shrublands{\textemdash}are responsible for most of the variability. Biological productivity in these semiarid regions is water-limited and strongly associated with variations in precipitation, unlike wetter tropical areas. Understanding carbon uptake by these marginal lands may help to improve predictions of variations in the global carbon cycle.Science, this issue p. 895The growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations since industrialization is characterized by large interannual variability, mostly resulting from variability in CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems (typically termed carbon sink). However, the contributions of regional ecosystems to that variability are not well known. Using an ensemble of ecosystem and land-surface models and an empirical observation-based product of global gross primary production, we show that the mean sink, trend, and interannual variability in CO2 uptake by terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by distinct biogeographic regions. Whereas the mean sink is dominated by highly productive lands (mainly tropical forests), the trend and interannual variability of the sink are dominated by semi-arid ecosystems whose carbon balance is strongly associated with circulation-driven variations in both precipitation and temperature.},

The CO$_{2}$ fluxes between the atmosphere and underlying land and ocean respond to changes in atmospheric CO$_{2}$ concentration and to changes in temperature and other climate variables. The carbon--concentration and carbon--climate feedback parameters characterize the response of the CO$_{2}$ flux between the atmosphere and the underlying surface to these changes.

	Abstract = {Climatic changes during the first half of the Common Era have been suggested to play a role in societal reorganizations in Europe1, 2 and Asia3, 4. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, pandemics7, 8, human migration and political turmoil8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Our understanding of the magnitude and spatial extent as well as the possible causes and concurrences of climate change during this period is, however, still limited. Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD (ref. 14), which was probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks15, 16, as well as a solar minimum17. We thus identify the interval from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age. Spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere, we suggest that this cold phase be considered as an additional environmental factor contributing to the establishment of the Justinian plague7, 8, transformation of the eastern Roman Empire and collapse of the Sasanian Empire1, 2, 5, movements out of the Asian steppe and Arabian Peninsula8, 11, 12, spread of Slavic-speaking peoples9, 10 and political upheavals in China},

	Abstract = {Multiple proxy data reveal that the early to middle Holocene (ca. 8-6 kyr B.P.) was warmer than the preindustrial period in most regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This warming is presumably explained by the higher summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere, owing to changes in the orbital parameters. Subsequent cooling in the late Holocene was accompanied by significant changes in vegetation cover and an increase in atmospheric CO$_{2}$ concentration. The essential question is whether it is possible to explain these changes in a consistent way, accounting for the orbital parameters as the main external forcing for the climate system. We investigate this problem using the computationally efficient model of climate system, CLIMBER-2, which includes models for oceanic and terrestrial biogeochemistry. We found that changes in climate and vegetation cover in the northern subtropical and circumpolar regions can be attributed to the changes in the orbital forcing. Explanation of the atmospheric CO$_{2}$ record requires an additional assumption of excessive CaCO3 sedimentation in the ocean. The modeled decrease in the carbonate ion concentration in the deep ocean is similar to that inferred from CaCO3 sediment data [Broecker et al., 1999]. For 8 kyr B.P., the model estimates the terrestrial carbon pool ca. 90 Pg higher than its preindustrial value. Simulated atmospheric d13C declines during the course of the Holocene, similar to d13C data from the Taylor Dome ice core [Indermu"hle et al., 1999]. Amplitude of simulated changes in d13C is smaller than in the data, while a difference between the model and the data is comparable with the range of data uncertainty},

	Abstract = {Abstract Changes in temperature and carbon dioxide during glacial cycles recorded in Antarctic ice cores are tightly coupled. However, this relationship does not hold for interglacials. While climate cooled towards the end of both the last (Eemian) and present (Holocene) interglacials, \{CO2\} remained stable during the Eemian while rising in the Holocene. We identify and review twelve biogeochemical mechanisms of terrestrial (vegetation dynamics and \{CO2\} fertilization, land use, wildfire, accumulation of peat, changes in permafrost carbon, subaerial volcanic outgassing) and marine origin (changes in sea surface temperature, carbonate compensation to deglaciation and terrestrial biosphere regrowth, shallow-water carbonate sedimentation, changes in the soft tissue pump, and methane hydrates), which potentially may have contributed to the \{CO2\} dynamics during interglacials but which remain not well quantified. We use three Earth System Models (ESMs) of intermediate complexity to compare effects of selected mechanisms on the interglacial \{CO2\} and δ13CO2 changes, focusing on those with substantial potential impacts: namely carbonate sedimentation in shallow waters, peat growth, and (in the case of the Holocene) human land use. A set of specified carbon cycle forcings could qualitatively explain atmospheric \{CO2\} dynamics from 8 ka \{BP\} to the pre-industrial. However, when applied to Eemian boundary conditions from 126 to 115 ka BP, the same set of forcings led to disagreement with the observed direction of \{CO2\} changes after 122 ka BP. This failure to simulate late-Eemian \{CO2\} dynamics could be a result of the imposed forcings such as prescribed CaCO3 accumulation and/or an incorrect response of simulated terrestrial carbon to the surface cooling at the end of the interglacial. These experiments also reveal that key natural processes of interglacial \{CO2\} dynamics -- shallow water CaCO3 accumulation, peat and permafrost carbon dynamics - are not well represented in the current ESMs. Global-scale modeling of these long-term carbon cycle components started only in the last decade, and uncertainty in parameterization of these mechanisms is a main limitation in the successful modeling of interglacial \{CO2\} dynamics. },

	Abstract = {The sensitivity of the climate--biogeochemistry system to volcanic eruptions is investigated using the comprehensive Earth System Model developed at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The model includes an interactive carbon cycle with modules for terrestrial biosphere as well as ocean biogeochemistry. The volcanic forcing is based on a recent reconstruction for the last 1200 yr. An ensemble of five simulations is performed and the averaged response of the system is analysed in particular for the largest eruption of the last millennium in the year 1258. After this eruption, the global annual mean temperature drops by 1 K and recovers slowly during 10 yr. Atmospheric CO$_{2}$ concentration declines during 4 yr after the eruption by ca. 2 ppmv to its minimum value and then starts to increase towards the pre-eruption level. This CO$_{2}$ decrease is explained mainly by reduced heterotrophic respiration on land in response to the surface cooling, which leads to increased carbon storage in soils, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. The ocean acts as a weak carbon sink, which is primarily due to temperature-induced solubility. This sink saturates 2 yr after the eruption, earlier than the land uptake.},

	Abstract = {We assess the role of changing natural (volcanic, aerosol, insolation) and anthropogenic ({CO}$_2$ emissions, land cover) forcings on the global climate system over the last 150 years using an earth system model of intermediate complexity, CLIMBER-2. We apply several datasets of historical land-use reconstructions: the cropland dataset by Ramankutty \& Foley (1999) (R\&F), the HYDE land cover dataset of Klein Goldewijk (2001), and the land-use emissions data from Houghton \& Hackler (2002). Comparison between the simulated and observed temporal evolution of atmospheric {CO}$_2$ and delta(13)CO(2) are used to evaluate these datasets. To check model uncertainty, CLIMBER-2 was coupled to the more complex Lund-Potsdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model. In simulation with R\&F dataset, biogeophysical mechanisms due to land cover changes tend to decrease global air temperature by 0.26degreesC, while biogeochemical mechanisms act to warm the climate by 0.18degreesC. The net effect on climate is negligible on a global scale, but pronounced over the land in the temperate and high northern latitudes where a cooling due to an increase in land surface albedo offsets the warming due to land-use {CO}$_2$ emissions. Land cover changes led to estimated increases in atmospheric {CO}$_2$ of between 22 and 43 ppmv. Over the entire period 1800-2000, simulated delta(13)CO(2) with HYDE compares most favourably with ice core during 1850-1950 and Cape Grim data, indicating preference of earlier land clearance in HYDE over R\&F. In relative terms, land cover forcing corresponds to 25-49\% of the observed growth in atmospheric {CO}$_2$. This contribution declined from 36-60\% during 1850-1960 to 4-35\% during 1960-2000. CLIMBER-2-LPJ simulates the land cover contribution to atmospheric {CO}$_2$ growth to decrease from 68\% during 1900-1960 to 12\% in the 1980s. Overall, our simulations show a decline in the relative role of land cover changes for atmospheric {CO}$_2$ increase during the last 150 years. },

	Abstract = {We present a synthesis of the land-atmosphere carbon flux from land use and land cover change (LULCC) in Asia using multiple data sources and paying particular attention to deforestation and forest regrowth fluxes. The data sources are quasi-independent and include the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization-Forest Resource Assessment (FAO-FRA 2015; country-level inventory estimates), the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.3), the `Houghton' bookkeeping model that incorporates FAO-FRA data, an ensemble of 8 state-of-the-art Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVM), and 2 recently published independent studies using primarily remote sensing techniques. The estimates are aggregated spatially to Southeast, East, and South Asia and temporally for three decades, 1980--1989, 1990--1999 and 2000--2009. Since 1980, net carbon emissions from LULCC in Asia were responsible for 20%--40% of global LULCC emissions, with emissions from Southeast Asia alone accounting for 15%--25% of global LULCC emissions during the same period. In the 2000s and for all Asia, three estimates (FAO-FRA, DGVM, Houghton) were in agreement of a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, with mean estimates ranging between 0.24 to 0.41 Pg C yr −1 , whereas EDGARv4.3 suggested a net carbon sink of −0.17 Pg C yr −1 . Three of 4 estimates suggest that LULCC carbon emissions declined by at least 34% in the preceding decade (1990--2000). Spread in the estimates is due to the inclusion of different flux components and their treatments, showing the importance to include emissions from carbon rich peatlands and land management, such as shifting cultivation and wood harvesting, which appear to be consistently underreported.},

@article{Dull2010,
	Abstract = {Pre-Columbian farmers of the Neotropical lowlands numbered an estimated 25 million by 1492, with at least 80 percent living within forest biomes. It is now well established that significant areas of Neotropical forests were cleared and burned to facilitate agricultural activities before the arrival of Europeans. Paleoecological and archaeological evidence shows that demographic pressure on forest resources---facilitated by anthropogenic burning---increased steadily throughout the LateHolocene, peaking when Europeans arrived in the late fifteenth century. The introduction of Old World diseases led to recurrent epidemics and resulted in an unprecedented population crash throughout the Neotropics. The rapid demographic collapse was mostly complete by 1650, by which time it is estimated that about 95 percent of all indigenous inhabitants of the region had perished. We review fire history records from throughout the Neotropical lowlands and report new high-resolution charcoal records and demographic estimates that together support the idea that theNeotropical lowlands went from being a net source of CO$_{2}$ to the atmosphere before Columbus to a net carbon sink for several centuries following the Columbian encounter. We argue that the regrowth of Neotropical forests following the Columbian encounter led to terrestrial biospheric carbon sequestration on the order of 2 to 5 Pg C, thereby contributing to the well- documented decrease in atmosphericCO$_{2}$ recorded in Antarctic ice cores from about 1500 through 1750, a trend previously attributed exclusively to decreases in solar irradiance and an increase in global volcanic activity. We conclude that the post-Columbian carbon sequestration event was a significant forcing mechanism of Little Ice Age cooling.},

	Abstract = {Human use of land has transformed ecosystem pattern and process across most of the terrestrial biosphere, a global change often described as historically recent and potentially catastrophic for both humanity and the biosphere. Interdisciplinary paleoecological, archaeological, and historical studies challenge this view, indicating that land use has been extensive and sustained for millennia in some regions and that recent trends may represent as much a recovery as an acceleration. Here we synthesize recent scientific evidence and theory on the emergence, history, and future of land use as a process transforming the Earth System and use this to explain why relatively small human populations likely caused widespread and profound ecological changes more than 3,000 y ago, whereas the largest and wealthiest human populations in history are using less arable land per person every decade. Contrasting two spatially explicit global reconstructions of land-use history shows that reconstructions incorporating adaptive changes in land-use systems over time, including land-use intensification, offer a more spatially detailed and plausible assessment of our planet's history, with a biosphere and perhaps even climate long ago affected by humans. Although land-use processes are now shifting rapidly from historical patterns in both type and scale, integrative global land-use models that incorporate dynamic adaptations in human--environment relationships help to advance our understanding of both past and future land-use changes, including their sustainability and potential global effects.},

@article{Elsig2009,
	Abstract = {Reconstructions of atmospheric CO(2) concentrations based on Antarctic ice cores reveal significant changes during the Holocene epoch, but the processes responsible for these changes in CO(2) concentrations have not been unambiguously identified. Distinct characteristics in the carbon isotope signatures of the major carbon reservoirs (ocean, biosphere, sediments and atmosphere) constrain variations in the CO(2) fluxes between those reservoirs. Here we present a highly resolved atmospheric delta(13)C record for the past 11,000 years from measurements on atmospheric CO(2) trapped in an Antarctic ice core. From mass-balance inverse model calculations performed with a simplified carbon cycle model, we show that the decrease in atmospheric CO(2) of about 5 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.). The increase in delta(13)C of about 0.25 per thousand during the early Holocene is most probably the result of a combination of carbon uptake of about 290 gigatonnes of carbon by the land biosphere and carbon release from the ocean in response to carbonate compensation of the terrestrial uptake during the termination of the last ice age. The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO(2) and the small decrease in delta(13)C of about 0.05 per thousand during the later Holocene can mostly be explained by contributions from carbonate compensation of earlier land-biosphere uptake and coral reef formation, with only a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land-biosphere carbon inventory.},

	Abstract = {Maps of continental-scale land cover are utilized by a range of diverse users but whilst a range of products exist that describe present and recent land cover in Europe, there are currently no datasets that describe past variations over long time-scales. User groups with an interest in past land cover include the climate modelling community, socio-ecological historians and earth system scientists. Europe is one of the continents with the longest histories of land conversion from forest to farmland, thus understanding land cover change in this area is globally significant. This study applies the pseudobiomization method (PBM) to 982 pollen records from across Europe, taken from the European Pollen Database (EPD) to produce a first synthesis of pan-European land cover change for the period 9000 bp to present, in contiguous 200 year time intervals. The PBM transforms pollen proportions from each site to one of eight land cover classes (LCCs) that are directly comparable to the CORINE land cover classification. The proportion of LCCs represented in each time window provides a spatially aggregated record of land cover change for temperate and northern Europe, and for a series of case study regions (western France, the western Alps, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia). At the European scale, the impact of Neolithic food producing economies appear to be detectable from 6000 bp through reduction in broad-leaf forests resulting from human land use activities such as forest clearance. Total forest cover at a pan-European scale moved outside the range of previous background variability from 4000 bp onwards. From 2200 bp land cover change intensified, and the broad pattern of land cover for preindustrial Europe was established by 1000 bp. Recognizing the timing of anthropogenic land cover change in Europe will further the understanding of land cover-climate interactions, and the origins of the modern cultural landscape.},

	Abstract = {Testing against historical data is an important step for validating integrated models of global environmental change. Owing to long time lags in the climate system, these models should aim the simulation of the land use dynamics for long periods, i.e., spanning decades up to a century. Developing such models requires understanding of past and current trends and is therefore strongly data dependent. For this purpose, a history database of the global environment has been developed: {HYDE}. This paper describes and analyzes parts of {HYDE} version 2.0, presenting historical population and land use patterns for the past 300 years. Results suggest, among other things, a global increase of cropland area from 265 million ha in 1700 to 1471 million ha in 1990, while the area of pasture has increased more than six fold from 524 to 3451 million ha. In general, the increase of man-made agricultural land took place at the expense of natural grasslands and to a lesser extent of forests. There are differences between the several regions in the temporal pace of these land use conversions. The temperate/developed regions of Canada, United States, USSR, and Oceania appear to have had their strongest increase during the 19th century, while most of the tropical/developing regions witnessed the largest land use conversions at the end of the last century. Results of this analysis can be used to test integrated models of global change and are available at http://www.rivm.nl/env/int/hyde/. },

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional climate model was used to perform 25 simulations over the last millennium, which are driven by the main natural and anthropogenic forcing. The results are compared to available reconstructions in order to evaluate the relative contribution of internal and forced variability during this period. At hemispheric and nearly hemispheric scale, the impact of the forcing is clear in all the simulations and knowing the forced response provides already a large amount of information about the behaviour of the climate system. Besides, at regional and local scales, the forcing has only a weak contribution to the simulated variability compared to internal variability. This result could be used to refine our conception of Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age (MWP and LIA). They were hemispheric-scale phenomena, since the temperature averaged over the Northern Hemisphere was, respectively generally higher/lower during those periods because of a stronger/weaker external forcing at that time. Nevertheless, at local-scale, the sign of the internal temperature variations determines to what extent the forced response will be actually visible or even masked by internal noise. Because of this role of internal variability, synchronous peak temperatures during the \{MWP\} or \{LIA\} between different locations are unlikely. },

Most analyses have used three quasi-independent estimates of land-use change that are based on national and international agricultural and forestry data of limited accuracy in many countries. Further, the estimates of biomass used in the analyses have a common but limited literature base, which fails to address the spatial variability of biomass density within ecosystems. In contrast to the sources of information that have been used to date, a combination of existing ground and remote sensing data are available to determine with far higher accuracy rates of land-use change, aboveground biomass density, and, hence, the net flux of carbon from land use and land-use change.},

	Abstract = {To accurately assess the impacts of human land use on the Earth system, information is needed on the current and historical patterns of land-use activities. Previous global studies have focused on developing reconstructions of the spatial patterns of agriculture. Here, we provide the first global gridded estimates of the underlying land conversions (land-use transitions), wood harvesting, and resulting secondary lands annually, for the period 1700--2000. Using data-based historical cases, our results suggest that 42--68{\%} of the land surface was impacted by land-use activities (crop, pasture, wood harvest) during this period, some multiple times. Secondary land area increased 10--44 × 106 km2; about half of this was forested. Wood harvest and shifting cultivation generated 70--90{\%} of the secondary land by 2000; permanent abandonment and relocation of agricultural land accounted for the rest. This study provides important new estimates of globally gridded land-use activities for studies attempting to assess the consequences of anthropogenic changes to the Earth's surface over time.},

@article{Klein2013,
	Abstract = {Land use and land-use change play an important role in global integrated assessments. However, there are still many uncertainties in the role of current and historical land use in the global carbon cycle as well as in other dimensions of global environmental change. Although databases of histor- ical land use are frequently used in integrated assess- ments and climate studies, they are subject to considerable uncertainties that often are ignored. This paper examines a number of the most important uncertainties related to the process of reconstructing historical land use. We discuss the origins of different types of uncertainty and the sensitivity of land-use reconstructions to these uncertainties. The results indicate that uncertainties not only arise as result of the large temporal and spatial variation in historical population data, but also relate to assumptions on the relationship between population and land use used in the reconstructions. Improving empirical data to better specify and validate the assumptions about the rela- tionship between population and land use, while accounting for the spatial and temporal variation, could reduce uncertainties in the reconstructions. Such empirical evidence could be derived from local case studies, such as those conducted in landscape ecology, environmental history, archeology and paleoecology.},

	Abstract = {CO$_{2}$ and CH4 composition of the atmosphere increased rapidly following the industrial revolution. Recently Ruddiman has suggested that increases in the anthropogenic contribution to atmospheric greenhouse gases had actually begun thousands of years earlier. Research on climates indicates that a cooling and drying trend developed from about 5000 BP across the Asian monsoonal region. Archaeological and biological data reveal that from about the same time there was an important transition point corresponding to the rapid growth of population and expansion of cultivated rice areas. Extensive deforestation also occurred from this time. The expansion of rice agriculture and extended wetland areas provided more sources of methane emissions, and thus contributed to greenhouse gas budgets. The climate impacts of increased anthropogenic methane emissions were possibly counterbalanced in part by any natural decrease from orbital forcing. The methane contribution from rice paddy areas is estimated to be smaller than 250 ppb for the middle-late Neolithic. The 1000-ppb methane rise after industrial era coincides closely with the rapid growth of global human populations, and anthropogenic driven sources. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.},

	Abstract = {Native American populations declined between 1492 and 1900 CE, instigated by the European colonization of the Americas. However, the magnitude, tempo, and ecological effects of this depopulation remain the source of enduring debates. Recently, scholars have linked indigenous demographic decline, Neotropical reforestation, and shifting fire regimes to global changes in climate, atmosphere, and the Early Anthropocene hypothesis. In light of these studies, we assess these processes in conifer-dominated forests of the Southwest United States. We compare light detection and ranging data, archaeology, dendrochronology, and historical records from the Jemez Province of New Mexico to quantify population losses, establish dates of depopulation events, and determine the extent and timing of forest regrowth and fire regimes between 1492 and 1900. We present a new formula for the estimation of Pueblo population based on architectural remains and apply this formula to 18 archaeological sites in the Jemez Province. A dendrochronological study of remnant wood establishes dates of terminal occupation at these sites. By combining our results with historical records, we report a model of pre- and post-Columbian population dynamics in the Jemez Province. Our results indicate that the indigenous population of the Jemez Province declined by 87% following European colonization but that this reduction occurred nearly a century after initial contact. Depopulation also triggered an increase in the frequency of extensive surface fires between 1640 and 1900. Ultimately, this study illustrates the quality of integrated archaeological and paleoecological data needed to assess the links between Native American population decline and ecological change after European contact.},

	Abstract = {We conducted the first synchronously coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model simulation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the B{\o}lling-Aller{\o}d (BA) warming. Our model reproduces several major features of the deglacial climate evolution, suggesting a good agreement in climate sensitivity between the model and observations. In particular, our model simulates the abrupt BA warming as a transient response of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) to a sudden termination of freshwater discharge to the North Atlantic before the BA. In contrast to previous mechanisms that invoke AMOC multiple equilibrium and Southern Hemisphere climate forcing, we propose that the BA transition is caused by the superposition of climatic responses to the transient CO$_{2}$ forcing, the AMOC recovery from Heinrich Event 1, and an AMOC overshoot.},

Their rapid development contributed to the sustained peak in CH$_4$ and modest decline of CO$_2$ during the early Holocene and likely contributed to CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ fluctuations during earlier interglacial and interstadial transitions. Given the decreased tempo of peatland initiation in the late Holocene and the transition of many from fens (which generated high levels of CH$_4$) to ombrotrophic bogs, a neoglacial expansion of northern peatlands cannot explain the increase in atmospheric CH$_4$ that occurred after 6 ka.},

	Abstract = {FUTURE greenhouse warming is expected to be particularly pronounced in boreal regions1, and consequent changes in vegetation in these regions may in turn affect global climate2-4. It is therefore important to establish how boreal ecosystems might respond to rapid changes in climate. Here we present palaeoecological evidence for changes in terrestrial vegetation and lake characteristics during an episode of climate warming that occurred between 5,000 and 4,000 years ago at the boreal treeline in central Canada. The initial transformation - from tundra to forest-tundra on land, which coincided with increases in lake productivity, pH and ratio of inflow to evaporation - took only 150 years, which is roughly equivalent to the time period often used in modelling the response of boreal forests to climate warming5,6. The timing of the treeline advance did not coincide with the maximum in high-latitude summer insolation predicted by Milankovitch theory7, suggesting that northern Canada experienced regionally asynchronous middle-tolate Holocene shifts in the summer position of the Arctic front. Such Holocene climate events may provide a better analogue for the impact of future global change on northern ecosystems than the transition from glacial to nonglacial conditions.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the causes and consequences of wildfires in forests of the western United States requires integrated information about fire, climate changes, and human activity on multiple temporal scales. We use sedimentary charcoal accumulation rates to construct long-term variations in fire during the past 3,000 y in the American West and compare this record to independent fire-history data from historical records and fire scars. There has been a slight decline in burning over the past 3,000 y, with the lowest levels attained during the 20th century and during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1400-1700 CE [Common Era]). Prominent peaks in forest fires occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 950-1250 CE) and during the 1800s. Analysis of climate reconstructions beginning from 500 CE and population data show that temperature and drought predict changes in biomass burning up to the late 1800s CE. Since the late 1800s , human activities and the ecological effects of recent high fire activity caused a large, abrupt decline in burning similar to the LIA fire decline. Consequently, there is now a forest "fire deficit" in the western United States attributable to the combined effects of human activities, ecological, and climate changes. Large fires in the late 20th and 21st century fires have begun to address the fire deficit, but it is continuing to grow.},

We analyzed soils from 55 sites across central and western Amazonia to assess the history of human occupation. Sparse occurrences of charcoal and the lack of phytoliths from agricultural and disturbance species in the soils during pre-Columbian times indicated that human impacts on interfluvial forests were small, infrequent, and highly localized. No human artifacts or modified soils were found at any site surveyed. Riverine bluff areas also appeared less heavily occupied and disturbed than similar settings elsewhere. Our data indicate that human impacts on Amazonian forests were heterogeneous across this vast landscape.},

	Abstract = {Humanity has become a major player within the Earth system, particularly by transforming large parts of the land surface and by altering the gaseous composition of the atmosphere. Deforestation for agricultural purposes started thousands of years ago and might have resulted in a detectable human influence on climate much earlier than the industrial revolution. This study presents a first attempt to estimate the impact of human land-use on the global carbon cycle over the last 6,000 years. A global gridded data set for the spread of permanent and non-permanent agriculture over this time period was developed and inte- grated within the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM). The model was run with and without human land-use, and the difference in terres- trial carbon storage was calculated as an estimate of anthropogenic carbon release to the atmosphere. The modelled total carbon release during the industrial period (A.D. 1850--1990) was 148 gigatons of carbon (GtC), of which 33 GtC originated from non-permanent agriculture. For pre-industrial times (4000 B.C.--A.D. 1850), the net carbon release was 79 GtC from permanent agriculture with an additional 35 GtC from non-permanent agriculture. The modelled pre-industrial carbon release was consider- ably lower than would be required for a substantial influence on the climate system. Communicated},

	Abstract = { AbstractCentury-long observed gridded land precipitation datasets are a cornerstone of hydrometeorological research. But recent work has suggested that observed Northern Hemisphere midlatitude (NHML) land mean precipitation does not show evidence of an expected negative response to mid-twentieth-century aerosol forcing. Utilizing observed river discharges, the observed runoff is calculated and compared with observed land precipitation. The results show a near-zero twentieth-century trend in observed NHML land mean runoff, in contrast to the significant positive trend in observed NHML land mean precipitation. However, precipitation and runoff share common interannual and decadal variability. An obvious split, or breakpoint, is found in the NHML land mean runoff--precipitation relationship in the 1930s. Using runoff simulated by six land surface models (LSMs), which are driven by the observed precipitation dataset, such breakpoints are absent. These findings support previous hypotheses that inhomogeneities exist in the early-twentieth-century NHML land mean precipitation record. Adjusting the observed precipitation record according to the observed runoff record largely accounts for the departure of the observed precipitation response from that predicted given the real-world aerosol forcing estimate, more than halving the discrepancy from about 6 to around 2 W m−2. Consideration of complementary observed runoff adds support to the suggestion that NHML-wide early-twentieth-century precipitation observations are unsuitable for climate change studies. The agreement between precipitation and runoff over Europe, however, is excellent, supporting the use of whole-twentieth-century observed precipitation datasets here. },

	Abstract = {The nature and spatial scale of prehistoric human landscape modifications in Amazonia are enduring questions. Original conceptions of the issues by archaeologists published more than 40 years ago posited little human influence because of putative environmental constraints. Empirical data accumulated more recently demonstrated dense, permanent settlements along major watercourses of the central and southern Amazon, and profound landscape alterations in seasonally flooded savanna regions of Bolivia. These results led some investigators to propose that most to all of Amazonia was heavily populated and modified before European arrival, and that prehistoric fires and forest clearing were of such a massive scale that post-Columbian reforestation was a significant contributor to decreasing atmospheric CO2 levels and the onset of the `Little Ice Age'. Recent data generated from investigations of soils sampled from underneath standing terra firme forests in parts of the western Amazon indicate ephemeral ancient human occupation and little vegetation disturbance there. These issues are central to ongoing discussions surrounding the classification and timing of the Anthropocene, because a geological epoch proposed on the basis of profound human alteration of environments and considerations of when during the Holocene it should begin, require robust paleo-environmental and archaeological data from major, critically important zones such as the Amazon Basin. This paper reviews debates and existing information on prehistoric human influences in Amazonia, provides new data from the western Amazon, and attempts to arrive at reasonable conclusions based on the available empirical data.},

	Abstract = {The significance and cause of the decline in biomass burning across the Americas after AD 1500 is a topic of considerable debate. We synthesized charcoal records (a proxy for biomass burning) from the Americas and from the remainder of the globe over the past 2000 years, and compared these with paleoclimatic records and population reconstructions. A distinct post-AD 1500 decrease in biomass burning is evident, not only in the Americas, but also globally, and both are similar in duration and timing to `Little Ice Age' climate change. There is temporal and spatial variability in the expression of the biomass-burning decline across the Americas but, at a regional--continental scale, `Little Ice Age' climate change was likely more important than indigenous population collapse in driving this decline.},

	Abstract = {BIOME 6000 is an international project to map vegetation globally at mid-Holocene (6000 14C yr BP) and last glacial maximum (LGM, 18,000 14C yr BP), with a view to evaluating coupled climate-biosphere model results. Primary palaeoecological data are assigned to biomes using an explicit algorithm based on plant functional types. This paper introduces the second Special Feature on BIOME 6000. Site-based global biome maps are shown with data from North America, Eurasia (except South and Southeast Asia) and Africa at both time periods. A map based on surface samples shows the method's skill in reconstructing present-day biomes. Cold and dry conditions at LGM favoured extensive tundra and steppe. These biomes intergraded in northern Eurasia. Northern hemisphere forest biomes were displaced southward. Boreal evergreen forests (taiga) and temperate deciduous forests were fragmented, while European and East Asian steppes were greatly extended. Tropical moist forests (i.e. tropical rain forest and tropical seasonal forest) in Africa were reduced. In south-western North America, desert and steppe were replaced by open conifer woodland, opposite to the general arid trend but consistent with modelled southward displacement of the jet stream. The Arctic forest limit was shifted slighly north at 6000 14C yr BP in some sectors, but not in all. Northern temperate forest zones were generally shifted greater distances north. Warmer winters as well as summers in several regions are required to explain these shifts. Temperate deciduous forests in Europe were greatly extended, into the Mediterranean region as well as to the north. Steppe encroached on forest biomes in interior North America, but not in central Asia. Enhanced monsoons extended forest biomes in China inland and Sahelian vegetation into the Sahara while the African tropical rain forest was also reduced, consistent with a modelled northward shift of the ITCZ and a more seasonal climate in the equatorial zone. Palaeobiome maps show the outcome of separate, independent migrations of plant taxa in response to climate change. The average composition of biomes at LGM was often markedly different from today. Refugia for the temperate deciduous and tropical rain forest biomes may have existed offshore at LGM, but their characteristic taxa also persisted as components of other biomes. Examples include temperate deciduous trees that survived in cool mixed forest in eastern Europe, and tropical evergreen trees that survived in tropical seasonal forest in Africa. The sequence of biome shifts during a glacial-interglacial cycle may help account for some disjunct distributions of plant taxa. For example, the now-arid Saharan mountains may have linked Mediterranean and African tropical montane floras during enhanced monsoon regimes. Major changes in physical land-surface conditions, shown by the palaeobiome data, have implications for the global climate. The data can be used directly to evaluate the output of coupled atmosphere-biosphere models. The data could also be objectively generalized to yield realistic gridded land-surface maps, for use in sensitivity experiments with atmospheric models. Recent analyses of vegetation-climate feedbacks have focused on the hypothesized positive feedback effects of climate-induced vegetation changes in the Sahara/Sahel region and the Arctic during the mid-Holocene. However, a far wider spectrum of interactions potentially exists and could be investigated, using these data, both for 6000 14C yr BP and for the LGM.},

	Abstract = {The eastern Mediterranean region witnessed changes in human culture of the highest importance between {\~{}}9000 and {\~{}}2500 cal. BP (7000---500 BC) and over the same time period was affected by very significant shifts in climate. Stable isotope data from lake and deep-sea sediment cores and from cave speleothems show an overall trend from a wetter to a drier climate during the mid Holocene. Superimposed on this trend were multicentennial oscillations in climate, with notable arid phases occurring around 5300---5000 BP, 4500---3900 BP, and 3100---2800 BP (all ages are expressed in calibrated/ calendar years). These phases coincide with major archaeological transitions across the eastern Mediterranean region (Chalcolithic to early Bronze Age, EBA to MBA, and LBA to Iron Age) implying that environmental stress or opportunity may have acted as a pacemaker for cultural change and re-organisation. We use 14C and $\delta$ 13C analysis of archaeobotanical samples from two protohistoric sites in Syria to illustrate the linkage between water availability, climate and cultural change during the third and second millennia BC. Specific societal responses to environmental change were not predictable in advance, but resulted instead from contingent processes involving antecedent conditions, human choice and adaptive strategies. Pollen analysis highlights how changes in climate were coupled to increasing human impacts to transform the region's landscapes. Initial human-induced land-cover transformation commonly took place during Bronze Age times, sometimes coinciding with phases of drier climate, although the pattern and precise timing varied between sites. Changes in climate between the early and late Holocene thus helped to transform eastern Mediterranean landscape ecologies and human cultures, but in complex, non-deterministic ways.},

	Abstract = { AbstractReconstructions of past climate show notable temperature variability over the past millennium, with relatively warm conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and a relatively cold Little Ice Age (LIA). Multimodel simulations of the past millennium are used together with a wide range of reconstructions of Northern Hemispheric mean annual temperature to separate climate variability from 850 to 1950 CE into components attributable to external forcing and internal climate variability. External forcing is found to contribute significantly to long-term temperature variations irrespective of the proxy reconstruction, particularly from 1400 onward. Over the MCA alone, however, the effect of forcing is only detectable in about half of the reconstructions considered, and the response to forcing in the models cannot explain the warm conditions around 1000 CE seen in some reconstructions. The residual from the detection analysis is used to estimate internal variability independent from climate modeling, and it is found that the recent observed 50- and 100-yr hemispheric temperature trends are substantially larger than any of the internally generated trends even using the large residuals over the MCA. Variations in solar output and explosive volcanism are found to be the main drivers of climate change from 1400 to 1900, but for the first time a significant contribution from greenhouse gas variations to the cold conditions during 1600--1800 is also detected. The proxy reconstructions tend to show a smaller forced response than is simulated by the models. This discrepancy is shown, at least partly, to be likely associated with the difference in the response to large volcanic eruptions between reconstructions and model simulations. },

	Abstract = {Carbon emissions from anthropogenic land use (LU) and land use change (LUC) are quantified with a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model for the past and the 21st century following Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Wood harvesting and parallel abandonment and expansion of agricultural land in areas of shifting cultivation are explicitly simulated (gross LUC) based on the Land Use Harmonization (LUH) dataset and a proposed alternative method that relies on minimum input data and generically accounts for gross LUC. Cumulative global LUC emissions are 72 GtC by 1850 and 243 GtC by 2004 and 27-151 GtC for the next 95 yr following the different RCP scenarios. The alternative method reproduces results based on LUH data with full transition information within <0.1 GtC/yr over the last decades and bears potential for applications in combination with other LU scenarios. In the last decade, shifting cultivation and wood harvest within remaining forests including slash each contributed 19% to the mean annual emissions of 1.2 GtC/yr. These factors, in combination with amplification effects under elevated CO$_{2}$, contribute substantially to future emissions from LUC in all RCPs.Keywords: land use change, carbon cycle, carbon budget, wood harvest, shifting cultivation, terrestrial carbon sink(Published: 3 June 2014)Citation: Tellus B 2014, 66, 23188, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusb.v66.23188},

	Abstract = {{A Dynamic Global Vegetation model coupled to a simplified Earth system model is used to simulate the impact of anthropogenic land cover changes (ALCC) on Holocene atmospheric CO(2) and the contemporary carbon cycle. The model results suggest that early agricultural activities cannot explain the mid to late Holocene CO(2) rise of 20 ppm measured on ice cores and that proposed upward revisions of Holocene ALCC imply a smaller contemporary terrestrial carbon sink. A set of illustrative scenarios is applied to test the robustness of these conclusions and to address the large discrepancies between published ALCC reconstructions. Simulated changes in atmospheric CO(2) due to ALCC are less than 1 ppm before 1000AD and 30 ppm at 2004AD when the HYDE3.1 ALCC reconstruction is prescribed for the past 12 000 years. Cumulative emissions of 69 GtC at 1850 and 233 GtC at 2004AD are comparable to earlier estimates. CO(2) changes due to ALCC exceed the simulated natural interannual variability only after 1000 AD. To consider evidence that land area used per person was higher before than during early industrialisation, agricultural areas from HYDE3.1 were increased by a factor of two prior to 1700AD (scenario H2). For the H2 scenario, the contemporary terrestrial carbon sink required to close the atmospheric CO(2) budget is reduced by 0.5 GtC yr(-1). Simulated CO(2) remains small even in scenarios where average land use per person is increased beyond the range of published estimates. Even extreme assumptions for preindustrial land conversion and high per- capita land use do not result in simulated CO(2) emissions that are sufficient to explain the magnitude and the timing of the late Holocene CO(2) increase.}},

	Abstract = {CO2 emissions from preindustrial land-use change (LUC) are subject to large uncertainties. Although atmospheric CO2 records suggest only a small land carbon (C) source since 5,000 y before present (5 kyBP), the concurrent C sink by peat buildup could mask large early LUC emissions. Here, we combine updated continuous peat C reconstructions with the land C balance inferred from double deconvolution analyses of atmospheric CO2 and d13C at different temporal scales to investigate the terrestrial C budget of the Holocene and the last millennium and constrain LUC emissions. LUC emissions are estimated with transient model simulations for diverging published scenarios of LU area change and shifting cultivation. Our results reveal a large terrestrial nonpeatland C source after the Mid-Holocene (66 ? 25 PgC at 7-5 kyBP and 115 ? 27 PgC at 5-3 kyBP). Despite high simulated per-capita CO2 emissions from LUC in early phases of agricultural development, humans emerge as a driver with dominant global C cycle impacts only in the most recent three millennia. Sole anthropogenic causes for particular variations in the CO2 record (20 ppm rise after 7 kyBP and 10 ppm fall between 1500 CE and 1600 CE) are not supported. This analysis puts a strong constraint on preindustrial vs. industrial-era LUC emissions and suggests that upper-end scenarios for the extent of agricultural expansion before 1850 CE are not compatible with the C budget thereafter.},

	Abstract = {Aims. We present a physically consistent reconstruction of the total solar irradiance for the Holocene. Methods. We extend the SATIRE models to estimate the evolution of the total (and partly spectral) solar irradiance over the Holocene. The basic assumption is that the variations of the solar irradiance are due to the evolution of the dark and bright magnetic features on the solar surface. The evolution of the decadally averaged magnetic flux is computed from decadal values of cosmogenic isotope concentrations recorded in natural archives employing a series of physics-based models connecting the processes from the modulation of the cosmic ray flux in the heliosphere to their record in natural archives. We then compute the total solar irradiance (TSI) as a linear combination of the jth and jth + 1 decadal values of the open magnetic flux. Results. Reconstructions of the TSI over the Holocene, each valid for a di{\_}erent paleomagnetic time series, are presented. Our analysis suggests that major sources of uncertainty in the TSI in this model are the heritage of the uncertainty of the TSI since 1610 reconstructed from sunspot data and the uncertainty of the evolution of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment. The analysis of the distribution functions of the reconstructed irradiance for the last 3000 years indicates that the estimates based on the virtual axial dipole moment are significantly lower at earlier times than the reconstructions based on the virtual dipole moment. Conclusions. We present the first physics-based reconstruction of the total solar irradiance over the Holocene, which will be of interest for studies of climate change over the last 11500 years. The reconstruction indicates that the decadally averaged total solar irradiance ranges over approximately 1.5 W/m2 from grand maxima to grand minima.},

	Abstract = {A 5-year-resolution absolute-dated oxygen isotope record from Dongge Cave, southern China, provides a continuous history of the Asian monsoon over the past 9000 years. Although the record broadly follows summer insolation, it is punctuated by eight weak monsoon events lasting \~{}1 to 5 centuries. One correlates with the {\textquotedblleft}8200-year{\textquotedblright} event, another with the collapse of the Chinese Neolithic culture, and most with North Atlantic ice-rafting events. Cross-correlation of the decadal- to centennial-scale monsoon record with the atmospheric carbon-14 record shows that some, but not all, of the monsoon variability at these frequencies results from changes in solar output.},

@article{Wang2005,
	Abstract = {[1] An inverse method is used to investigate the global carbon cycle from the early Holocene ( 8 kyr BP) to the end of the pre-industrial period ( 0 kyr BP) in an improved version of the "green'' McGill Paleoclimate Model (MPM). In this paper, we now take into account the vegetation-precipitation feedback and evaluate the terrestrial carbon cycle for the pre-industrial equilibrium. From our coupled transient simulation under orbital forcing, reconstructed ( Taylor Dome) atmospheric CO$_{2}$ forcing and a prescribed retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet ( LIS), we find a decrease of 70 PgC in total carbon storage in the Sahara region ( 15 degrees N to 30 degrees N and 15 degrees W to 50 degrees E), which is caused by the desertification simulated in the green MPM. The above decrease is partially compensated by an increase of 40 PgC in total carbon storage in the Southern Hemisphere from 8 to 2 kyr BP. From an analysis of the total carbon stored under the ice sheet, we can infer that this carbon has negligible impact on atmospheric CO$_{2}$ after 8 kyr BP. From our model results, we further conclude that the retreating LIS, together with the vegetation-albedo feedback, cause the global terrestrial carbon to increase from 8 to 6 kyr BP. The application of the inverse method suggests that the first 10 ppmv increase in atmospheric CO$_{2}$ from 8 to 6 kyr BP comes from the ocean. Finally, in the model simulations, the total terrestrial carbon release from 6 to 0 kyr BP is about 68 to 95 PgC, which would produce about a 5 to 7 ppmv atmospheric CO$_{2}$ increase, based on the calculation of Joos et al. ( 2004). Owing to our model limitation ( there is no ocean carbon cycle), we cannot conclude whether the overall oceanic CO$_{2}$ release from 8 to 0 kyr BP is due to outgassing related to SST changes or to calcite compensation as proposed by Broecker et al. ( 2001).},

@article{wanner08,
	Abstract = {The last 6000 years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically (in comparison to larger glacial-interglacial changes), and because abundant, detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period. We use selected proxy-based reconstructions of different climate variables, together with state-of-the-art time series of natural forcings (orbital variations, solar activity variations, large tropical volcanic eruptions, land cover and greenhouse gases), underpinned by results from General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs), to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the Mid-Holocene (MH) to pre-industrial time. The redistribution of solar energy, due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale, was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents. The associated summertime cooling of the NH, combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans, likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and, possibly, increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices up to the beginning of the last millennium. On decadal to multi-century timescales, a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima, tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multi-century scale cooling events was not found. However, reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multi-century scale cooling events, accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers, occurred in the NH (e.g., in Scandinavia and the European Alps). This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age (LIA) between AD ∼1350 and 1850, when the lower summer insolation in the NH, due to orbital forcing, coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions. The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling, the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations. Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics, but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes, with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere (SH). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Yu2011,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach using basal peat ages and carbon (C) accumulation profiles from the world's major peatland regions to decompose C flux terms from time-dependent C pool data observed from peat cores. Our peat-data syntheses show that the total peat C pools are 547 GtC, 50 GtC, and 15 GtC for northern, tropical and southern peatlands, respectively. The modeled net C balance (NCB) has a mean value of 41.8 TgC/yr for northern peatlands during the Holocene, ranging from 83.1 TgC/yr in the early Holocene around 9 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal. yr BP) to 21.5 TgC/yr around 2 ka, a temporal pattern mostly owing to the delayed effect of long-term decay of previously accumulated peat C. NCB from tropical and southern peatlands represents much smaller terms, mostly less than 10 TgC/yr. Northern peatlands represent about 90{\%} of global total peatland C pool of 612 GtC and {\textgreater}90{\%} of global peatland NCB. Our bottom-up global peatland synthesis indicates a decrease in rates of peatland area expansion and reduced CH4 emissions during the late Holocene, thus lending support for an anthropogenic source of late-Holocene CH4 rise. The C balance analysis of global peatland data indicates a cumulative net C uptake of 272 GtC in the early Holocene (11--7 ka), 151 GtC at 7--4 ka, and 116 GtC after 4 ka. The large cumulative fluxes and significant variations throughout the Holocene could greatly contribute to the observed atmospheric CO$_{2}$ and d13CO$_{2}$ patterns derived from Antarctic ice cores. Thus, global mass-balance calculations or climate--carbon cycle simulations have to consider these large net C uptake terms from global peatlands and their variations over the Holocene.},

	Abstract = {[1] Here we present a new data synthesis of global peatland ages, area changes, and carbon (C) pool changes since the Last Glacial Maximum, along with a new peatland map and total C pool estimates. The data show different controls of peatland expansion and C accumulation in different regions. We estimate that northern peatlands have accumulated 547 (473--621) GtC, showing maximum accumulation in the early Holocene in response to high summer insolation and strong summer -- winter climate seasonality. Tropical peatlands have accumulated 50 (44--55) GtC, with rapid rates about 8000--4000 years ago affected by a high and more stable sea level, a strong summer monsoon, and before the intensification of El Ni{\~{n}}o. Southern peatlands, mostly in Patagonia, South America, have accumulated 15 (13--18) GtC, with rapid accumulation during the Antarctic Thermal Maximum in the late glacial, and during the mid‐Holocene thermal maximum. This is the first comparison of peatland dynamics among these global regions. Our analysis shows that a diversity of drivers at different times have significantly impacted the global C cycle, through the contribution of peatlands to atmospheric CH4 budgets and the history of peatland CO$_{2}$ exchange with the atmosphere.

Patterns in water table depth explain patterns in wetlands at the global scale and vegetation gradients at regional and local scales. Overall, shallow groundwater influences 22 to 32\% of global land area, including ~15\% as groundwater-fed surface water features and 7 to 17\% with the water table or its capillary fringe within plant rooting depths.},

	ABSTRACT = {The increase in aridity, mainly by decreases in precipitation but also by higher temperatures, is likely the main threat to the diversity and survival of Mediterranean forests. Changes in land use, including the abandonment of extensive crop activities, mainly in mountains and remote areas, and the increases in human settlements and demand for more resources with the resulting fragmentation of the landscape, hinder the establishment of appropriate management tools to protect Mediterranean forests and their provision of services and biodiversity. Experiments and observations indicate that if changes in climate, land use and other components of global change, such as pollution and overexploitation of resources, continue, the resilience of many forests will likely be exceeded, altering their structure and function and changing, mostly decreasing, their capacity to continue to provide their current services. A consistent assessment of the impacts of the changes, however, remains elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining simultaneous and complete data for all scales of the impacts in the same forests, areas and regions. We review the impacts of climate change and other components of global change and their interactions on the terrestrial forests of Mediterranean regions, with special attention to their impacts on ecosystem services. Management tools for counteracting the negative effects of global change on Mediterranean ecosystem- services are finally discussed.},

              long term changes of the nature of the response of rate of CO2
              assimilation to intercellular p(CO2). The relationships between
              CO2 assimilation rate and biochemical components of leaf
              photosynthesis, such as ribulose-bisphosphate (RuP2)
              carboxylase-oxygenase activity and electron transport capacity
              are examined and related to current theory of CO2 assimilation in
              leaves of C3 species. It was found that the response of the rate
              of CO2 assimilation to irradiance, partial pressure of O2, p(O2),
              and temperature was different at low and high intercellular
              p(CO2), suggesting that CO2 assimilation rate is governed by
              different processes at low and high intercellular p(CO2). In
              longer term changes in CO2 assimilation rate, induced by
              different growth conditions, the initial slope of the response of
              CO2 assimilation rate to intercellular p(CO2) could be correlated

              consistent with the hypothesis that CO2 assimilation rate is

              carboxylase-oxygenase at low intercellular p(CO2) and by the rate

  abstract = "Gross primary production (GPP)-the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO)
              by leaves, and its conversion to sugars by photosynthesis-is the
              basis for life on land. Earth System Models (ESMs) incorporating
              the interactions of land ecosystems and climate are used to
              predict the future of the terrestrial sink for anthropogenic CO .
              ESMs require accurate representation of GPP. However, current
              ESMs disagree on how GPP responds to environmental variations ,
              suggesting a need for a more robust theoretical framework for
              modelling . Here, we focus on a key quantity for GPP, the ratio
              of leaf internal to external CO ($\chi$). $\chi$ is tightly
              regulated and depends on environmental conditions, but is
              represented empirically and incompletely in today's models. We
              show that a simple evolutionary optimality hypothesis predicts
              specific quantitative dependencies of $\chi$ on temperature,
              vapour pressure deficit and elevation; and that these same
              dependencies emerge from an independent analysis of empirical
              $\chi$ values, derived from a worldwide dataset of >3,500 leaf
              stable carbon isotope measurements. A single global equation
              embodying these relationships then unifies the empirical
              light-use efficiency model with the standard model of C
              photosynthesis , and successfully predicts GPP measured at
              eddy-covariance flux sites. This success is notable given the
              equation's simplicity and broad applicability across biomes and
              plant functional types. It provides a theoretical underpinning
              for the analysis of plant functional coordination across species
              and emergent properties of ecosystems, and a potential basis for
              the reformulation of the controls of GPP in next-generation ESMs.",

              carbon assimilation and typically rely on empirical estimates,
              including an assumed dependence on leaf nitrogen determined from
              soil fertility. In contrast, new theory, based on biochemical
              coordination and co-optimization of carboxylation and water costs
              for photosynthesis, suggests that optimal V can be predicted from
              climate alone, irrespective of soil fertility. Here, we develop
              this theory and find it captures 64\% of observed variability in
              a global, field-measured V dataset for C plants. Soil fertility
              indices explained substantially less variation (32\%). These
              results indicate that environmentally regulated biophysical
              constraints and light availability are the first-order drivers of
              global photosynthetic capacity. Through acclimation and
              adaptation, plants efficiently utilize resources at the leaf
              level, thus maximizing potential resource use for growth and

              evaluated the performance of different satellite indicators to
              detect strong drought effects on GPP in a beech forest in France

              (Pu{\'e}chabon), a temperate beech forest (Hainich), and a
              semi-arid grassland (Bugacpuszta). In Hesse, a three-year
              reduction in GPP following drought was detected only by the
              Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). The Photochemical Reflectance
              Index (PRI) also detected this drought effect, but only after
              normalization for absorbed light. In Pu{\'e}chabon normalized PRI
              outperformed the other indicators, while the short-term drought
              effect in Hainich was not detected by any tested indicator. In
              contrast, most indicators, but not PRI, captured the drought
              effects in Bugacpuszta. Hence, PRI improved detection of drought
              effects on GPP in forests and we propose that PRI normalized for

              responses can be efficiently modelled without recourse to

              been challenged by the lack of a transparent index for the cost

              negatively affects the land carbon sink. Although
              twentieth-century trends in drought regimes are ambiguous, across
              many regions more frequent and severe droughts are expected in
              the twenty-first century. Recovery time-how long an ecosystem
              requires to revert to its pre-drought functional state-is a
              critical metric of drought impact. Yet the factors influencing
              drought recovery and its spatiotemporal patterns at the global

              associated with climate and carbon cycle dynamics, with

              longest in the tropics and high northern latitudes (both

              the time between droughts may become shorter than drought

               overestimated the satellite-based estimates of leaf area and
               simulated delayed peak seasonal values in the northern

              fixation fluxes are key actions to guide climate change
              stakeholders in the application of mitigation strategies. In this
              study, we use the remote sensing model C-Fix at the local stand
              scale to improve the integration of algorithms for water and
              temperature limitation. These new algorithms are applied to
              estimate net ecosystem productivity in a fully water limited
              mode. Four different C-Fix scenarios (partially and fully water
              limited, partially and fully water limited with temperature
              conversion), to obtain net ecosystem productivity of European
              forests, were compared with \{EUROFLUX\} measurements using
              different statistics. In the first scenario (i) C-Fix is
              partially water limited since the \{NDVI\} is used as indicator
              for the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation
              (fAPAR). The \{NDVI\} depends on plant water availability at the
              long term (months). In the fully water limited C-Fix scenario
              (ii) short-term water availability is included taking into
              account soil moisture content. The third (iii) and fourth (iv)
              scenarios are respectively the partially and fully water limited
              scenarios wherein canopy and soil temperature, derived from the
              atmospheric temperature, are incorporated to account for the
              temperature driven processes of vegetation and soil. The error
              propagation by C-Fix was also analysed. Introducing water
              limitation and converting atmospheric temperature to apparent
              canopy and soil temperatures, significantly improves validation
              results based on \{EUROFLUX\} data. For pooled data, a final
              slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of the linear
              regression between C-Fix and \{EUROFLUX\} \{NEP\} values is 0.86,
              0.09 and 0.64, respectively. When implementing full water
              limitation a reduction of 42\% of the estimated \{NEP\} is
              obtained with respect to partially limited NEP. The error
              propagation by C-Fix for the partially and fully water limited
              cases and when applying temperature buffering, are similar.

              semi-empirical approaches, inclusion of full water limitation

              based model with potential in regional, continental and global
              dry matter estimations and in carbon uptake/release studies,

              understanding for reliably predicting photosynthetic capacity is
              still missing. To advance this understanding we have tested
              across C(3) plant species the coordination hypothesis, which
              assumes nitrogen allocation to photosynthetic processes such that
              photosynthesis tends to be co-limited by
              ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and regeneration.
              The coordination hypothesis yields an analytical solution to
              predict photosynthetic capacity and calculate area-based leaf
              nitrogen content (N(a)). The resulting model linking leaf
              photosynthesis, stomata conductance and nitrogen investment
              provides testable hypotheses about the physiological regulation
              of these processes. Based on a dataset of 293 observations for 31
              species grown under a range of environmental conditions, we
              confirm the coordination hypothesis: under mean environmental
              conditions experienced by leaves during the preceding month, RuBP
              carboxylation equals RuBP regeneration. We identify three key
              parameters for photosynthetic coordination: specific leaf area
              and two photosynthetic traits (k(3), which modulates N investment
              and is the ratio of RuBP carboxylation/oxygenation capacity
              (V(Cmax)) to leaf photosynthetic N content (N(pa)); and J(fac),
              which modulates photosynthesis for a given k(3) and is the ratio
              of RuBP regeneration capacity (J(max)) to V(Cmax)). With
              species-specific parameter values of SLA, k(3) and J(fac), our
              leaf photosynthesis coordination model accounts for 93\% of the
              total variance in N(a) across species and environmental
              conditions. A calibration by plant functional type of k(3) and
              J(fac) still leads to accurate model prediction of N(a), while
              SLA calibration is essentially required at species level.
              Observed variations in k(3) and J(fac) are partly explained by
              environmental and phylogenetic constraints, while SLA variation
              is partly explained by phylogeny. These results open a new avenue

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Soils are widely recognized as a non-renewable
              natural resource and as biophysical carbon sinks. As such, there
              is a growing requirement for global soil information. Although
              several global soil information systems already exist, these tend
              to suffer from inconsistencies and limited spatial detail.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present SoilGrids1km--a global
              3D soil information system at 1 km resolution--containing spatial
              predictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard
              depths): soil organic carbon (g kg-1), soil pH, sand, silt and
              clay fractions (\%), bulk density (kg m-3), cation-exchange
              capacity (cmol+/kg), coarse fragments (\%), soil organic carbon
              stock (t ha-1), depth to bedrock (cm), World Reference Base soil
              groups, and USDA Soil Taxonomy suborders. Our predictions are
              based on global spatial prediction models which we fitted, per
              soil variable, using a compilation of major international soil
              profile databases (ca. 110,000 soil profiles), and a selection of
              ca. 75 global environmental covariates representing soil forming
              factors. Results of regression modeling indicate that the most
              useful covariates for modeling soils at the global scale are
              climatic and biomass indices (based on MODIS images), lithology,
              and taxonomic mapping units derived from conventional soil survey
              (Harmonized World Soil Database). Prediction accuracies assessed
              using 5-fold cross-validation were between 23-51\%.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SoilGrids1km provide an initial set of
              examples of soil spatial data for input into global models at a
              resolution and consistency not previously available. Some of the
              main limitations of the current version of SoilGrids1km are: (1)
              weak relationships between soil properties/classes and
              explanatory variables due to scale mismatches, (2) difficulty to
              obtain covariates that capture soil forming factors, (3) low
              sampling density and spatial clustering of soil profile
              locations. However, as the SoilGrids system is highly automated
              and flexible, increasingly accurate predictions can be generated
              as new input data become available. SoilGrids1km are available

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OzFlux is the regional Australian and New Zealand flux tower network that aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess trends, and improve predictions, of Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate. This paper describes the evolution, design and current status of OzFlux as well as an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and found that the response of Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies but that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70 {\%}) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had similar radiation use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances including drought, fire, land use and land cover change, land management and climate change that are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The importance of ecological management for reducing the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change is increasingly recognized, yet frameworks to facilitate a structured approach to climate adaptation management are lacking. We developed a conceptual framework that can guide identification of climate change impacts and adaptive management options in a given region or biome. The framework focuses on potential points of early climate change impact, and organizes these along two main axes. First, it recognizes that climate change can act at a range of ecological scales. Secondly, it emphasizes that outcomes are dependent on two potentially interacting and countervailing forces: (1) changes to environmental parameters and ecological processes brought about by climate change, and (2) responses of component systems as determined by attributes of resistance and resilience. Through this structure, the framework draws together a broad range of ecological concepts, with a novel emphasis on attributes of resistance and resilience that can temper the response of species, ecosystems and landscapes to climate change. We applied the framework to the world's largest remaining Mediterranean-climate woodland, the 'Great Western Woodlands' of south-western Australia. In this relatively intact region, maintaining inherent resistance and resilience by preventing anthropogenic degradation is of highest priority and lowest risk. Limited, higher risk options such as fire management, protection of refugia and translocation of adaptive genes may be justifiable under more extreme change, hence our capacity to predict the extent of change strongly impinges on such management decisions. These conclusions may contrast with similar analyses in degraded landscapes, where natural integrity is already compromised, and existing investment in restoration may facilitate experimentation with higher risk options.},

abstract = {Global carbon balances are increasingly affected by large fluctuations in productivity occurring throughout semiarid regions. Recent analyses found a large C uptake anomaly in 2011 in arid and semiarid regions of the southern hemisphere. Consequently, we compared C and water fluxes of two distinct woody ecosystems (a Mulga (Acacia) woodland and a Corymbia savanna) between August 2012 and August 2014 in semiarid central Australia, demonstrating that the 2011 anomaly was short-lived in both ecosystems. The Mulga woodland was approximately C neutral but with periods of significant uptake within both years. The extreme drought tolerance of Acacia is presumed to have contributed to this. By contrast, the Corymbia savanna was a very large net C source (130 and 200gCm-2yr-1in average and below average rainfall years, respectively), which is likely to have been a consequence of the degradation of standing, senescent biomass that was a legacy of high productivity during the 2011 anomaly. The magnitude and temporal patterns in ecosystem water-use efficiencies (WUE), derived from eddy covariance data, differed across the two sites, which may reflect differences in the relative contributions of respiration to net C fluxes across the two ecosystems. In contrast, differences in leaf-scale measures of WUE, derived from13C stable isotope analyses, were apparent at small spatial scales and may reflect the different rooting strategies of Corymbia and Acacia trees within the Corymbia savanna. Restrictions on root growth and infiltration by a siliceous hardpan located below Acacia, whether in the Mulga woodland or in small Mulga patches of the Corymbia savanna, impedes drainage of water to depth, thereby producing a reservoir for soil moisture storage under Acacia while acting as a barrier to access of groundwater by Corymbia trees in Mulga patches, but not in the open Corymbia savanna.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering a considerable fraction of anthropogenic CO2, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. However, there is a gap in our understanding about the carbon dynamics of eucalypt (broadleaf evergreen) forests in temperate climates, which might differ from temperate evergreen coniferous or deciduous broadleaved forests given their fundamental differences in physiology, phenology and growth dynamics. To address this gap we undertook a 3-year study (2010–2012) of eddy covariance measurements in a dry temperate eucalypt forest in southeastern Australia. We determined the annual net carbon balance and investigated the temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability in and environmental controls of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). The forest was a large and constant carbon sink throughout the study period, even in winter, with an overall mean NEE of −1234 ± 109 (SE) g C m−2 yr−1. Estimated annual ER was similar for 2010 and 2011 but decreased in 2012 ranging from 1603 to 1346 g C m−2 yr−1, whereas GPP showed no significant inter-annual variability, with a mean annual estimate of 2728 ± 39 g C m−2 yr−1. All ecosystem carbon fluxes had a pronounced seasonality, with GPP being greatest during spring and summer and ER being highest during summer, whereas peaks in NEE occurred in early spring and again in summer. High NEE in spring was likely caused by a delayed increase in ER due to low temperatures. A strong seasonal pattern in environmental controls of daytime and night-time NEE was revealed. Daytime NEE was equally explained by incoming solar radiation and air temperature, whereas air temperature was the main environmental driver of night-time NEE. The forest experienced unusual above-average annual rainfall during the first 2 years of this 3-year period so that soil water content remained relatively high and the forest was not water limited. Our results show the potential of temperate eucalypt forests to sequester large amounts of carbon when not water limited. However, further studies using bottom-up approaches are needed to validate measurements from the eddy covariance flux tower and to account for a possible underestimation in ER due to advection fluxes.},

abstract = {Old-growth forests can accumulate carbon. However, what controls the rate of net carbon accumulation in those old-growth forests is still poorly understood. Using eddy flux measurements from two old-growth evergreen broadleaf forests (subtropical forest and tropical forest) in southern China, we compared the seasonal and inter-annual variations in the carbon fluxes of those two forests and quantified the major drivers for these temporal variations. The measured flux data showed that the annual net carbon uptake of the subtropical forest was generally much larger than that for the tropical forest. The mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over 6 years was -397±94gCm-2yr-1for the subtropical forest and -166±49gCm-2yr-1for the tropical forest with different seasonal variations. The subtropical forest was a carbon sink for most months in a year, while the tropical forest was a carbon source in wet seasons (positive NEE) and a carbon sink in dry seasons (negative NEE). Both forests were stronger carbon sink in dry years, because of much larger reduction in ER than in wet years. At the seasonal scale, GPP in wet seasons was 37.1{\%} higher than that for dry seasons in the subtropical forest, and was only 12.4{\%} higher in the tropical forest. The amplitude of seasonal GPP variation in the tropical forest was much weaker than in the subtropical forest, but the amplitude of the seasonal variation in ER was much larger than in the subtropical forest. The seasonal variation in NEE was largely driven by the variation in monthly ER of the tropical forest, and by both seasonal variations in monthly GPP and ER of the subtropical forest. At inter-annual scale, annual NEE varied tightly with annual rainfall from year to year. Therefore annual rainfall was suggested a fundamental driver of annual carbon sequestration in the subtropical and tropical forests in southern China. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

With statistical significance, the monthly GEP and RE increased exponentially with air temperature, but the monthly NEP was less sensitive and only increased linearly with air temperature. However, the function response of monthly NEP and its components (GEP and RE) disappeared under high temperature and low soil moisture. Monthly and yearly RE showed a statistically linear and positive dependence on the corresponding GEP. Annual NEP varied among years from 306 to 430 g C m(-2) (mean 395, SD 50). Interannual variability in NEP was controlled primarily by air temperature and the ratio of precipitation and evapotranspiration that affected the RE/GEP ratio, which varied between 0.76 and 0.81 (mean 0.78, SD 0.02).},

abstract = {Quantifying the surface energy fluxes of grazed and ungrazed steppes is essential to understand the roles of grasslands in local and global climate and in land use change. We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010–2012). Near 95{\%} of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5{\%} at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared {\~{}}50{\%} of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn − G) and H indicated a “cooling effect” feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year. Grazing not only caused an LE shift between the dry and the wet year, but also triggered a decrease in the H/Rn because of changes in vegetation and soil properties, indicating that the ungrazed area had a greater resistance while the grazed area had a greater sensitivity of EB components to the changing climate.},

abstract = {Post-fire salvage logging is a common silvicultural practice around the world, with the potential to alter the regenerative capacity of an ecosystem and thus its role as a source or a sink of carbon. However, there is no information on the effect of burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance. Here, we examine for the first time the effect of post-fire burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance by comparing the carbon exchange of two treatments in a burnt Mediterranean coniferous forest treated by salvage logging (SL, felling and removing the logs and masticating the woody debris) and Non-Intervention (NI, all trees left standing) using eddy covariance measurements. Using different partitioning approaches, we analyze the evolution of photosynthesis and respiration processes together with measurements of vegetation cover and soil respiration and humidity to interpret the differences in the measured fluxes and underlying processes. Results show that SL enhanced CO2emissions of this burnt pine forest by more than 120gCm-2compared to the NI treatment for the period June-December 2009. Although soil respiration was around 30{\%} higher in NI during growing season, this was more than offset by photosynthesis, as corroborated by increases in vegetation cover and evapotranspiration. Since SL is counterproductive to climate-change and Kyoto protocol objectives of optimal C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, less aggressive burnt wood management policies should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forests in Mediterranean Europe are located in a hot spot for tropospheric ozone formation. We applied two canopy-level stomatal conductance models (Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models) to two Mediterranean evergreen forests (Umbrella pine at San Rossore, and Holm oak at Castelporziano, in central Italy), which is essential for assessing ozone impact on forests via the stomatal flux-based approach. Parameterizations of the models was carried out by the Eddy Covariance technique. Both Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models well explained the observed stomatal conductance and stomatal ozone flux in both forests. Maximum stomatal conductance was 72{\%} higher in Umbrella pine than in Holm oak, leading to higher stomatal ozone flux. Inclusion of a soil water function improved the performance of the Jarvis-type model for the estimation of stomatal ozone flux. We found contrasting results concerning the coefficient m (the slope of the photosynthesis-stomatal conductance relationship) in the Ball-Woodrow-Berry model between the two forests: while m was constant for varying soil water status in the Holm oak forest, it declined with soil drying in the Umbrella pine forest. This may result from higher stomatal sensitivity to drought in Umbrella pine as a response to avoid drought stress. Overall, these results advance our understanding of ozone risk assessment in Mediterranean forests.},

  title    = "Coordination theory of leaf nitrogen distribution in a canopy",
  author   = "Chen, Jia-Lin and Reynolds, James F and Harley, Peter C and
              Tenhunen, John D",
  abstract = "It has long been observed that leaf nitrogen concentrations
              decline with depth in closed canopies in a number of plant
              communities. This phenomenon is generally believed to be related
              to a changing radiation environment and it has been suggested by
              some researchers that plants allocate nitrogen in order to
              optimize total whole canopy photosynthesis. Although optimization
              theory has been successfully utilized to describe a variety of
              physiological and ecological phenomena, it has some shortcomings
              that are subject to criticism (e.g., time constraints,
              oversimplifications, lack of insights, etc.). In this paper we
              present an alternative to the optimization theory of plant canopy
              nitrogen distribution, which we term coordination theory. We
              hypothesize that plants allocate nitrogen to maintain a balance
              between two processes, each of which is dependent on leaf
              nitrogen content and each of which potentially limits
              photosynthesis. These two processes are defined as Wc, the
              Rubiscolimited rate of carboxylation, and Wj, the electron
              transport-limited rate of carboxylation. We suggest that plants
              allocate nitrogen differentially to, leaves in different canopy
              layers in such a way that Wc and Wj remain roughly balanced. In
              this scheme, the driving force for the allocation of nitrogen
              within a canopy is the difference between the leaf nitrogen
              content that is required to bring Wc and Wj into balance and the
              current nitrogen content. We show that the daily carbon
              assimilation of a canopy with a nitrogen distribution resulting
              from this internal coordination of Wc and Wj is very similar to
              that obtained using optimization theory.",

              282,000 meter candles at the bottom of a Warburg manometric
              vessel. With such a high intensity available it was possible to
              measure the rate of photosynthesis of single fronds of Cabomba
              caroliniana over a large range of intensities and CO(2)
              concentrations. 2. The data obtained are described with high
              precision by the equation KI = p/(p(2) (max.) - p(2))((1/2))
              where p is the rate of photosynthesis at light intensity I, K is
              a constant which locates the curve on the I axis, and p(max.) is
              the asymptotic maximum rate of photosynthesis. With CO(2)
              concentration substituted for I, this equation describes the data
              of photosynthesis for Cabomba, as a function of CO(2)
              concentration. 3. The above equation also describes the data
              obtained by other investigators for photosynthesis as a function
              of intensity, and of CO(2) concentration where external diffusion
              rate is not the limiting factor. This shows that for different
              species of green plants there is a fundamental similarity in
              kinetic properties and therefore probably in chemical mechanism.
              4. A derivation of the above equation can be made in terms of
              half-order photochemical and Blackman reactions, with intensity
              and CO(2) concentration entering as the first power, or if both
              sides of the equation are squared, the photochemical and Blackman
              reactions are first order and intensity and CO(2) enter as the
              square. The presence of fractional exponents or intensity as the
              square suggests a complex reaction mechanism involving more than
              one photochemical reaction. This is consistent with the
              requirement of 4 quanta for the reduction of a CO(2) molecule.",

Using monthly time steps, modelled stomatal responses toD were used to calculate the ratio of stomatal cavity to ambient CO2 mole fractions and then, in association with leaf internal conductances, to calculate $\Delta$A. Weighted according to gross primary productivity (GPP, annual net CO2 asimilation per unit ground area), estimated $\Delta$A for C3 biomes ranged from 12.9{\texttenthousand} for xerophytic woods and shrub to 19.6{\texttenthousand} for cool/cold deciduous forest, with an average value from C3 plants of 17.8{\texttenthousand}. This is slightly less than the commonly used values of 18--20{\texttenthousand}. For C4 plants the average modelled discrimination was 3.6{\texttenthousand}, again slightly less than would be calculated from C4 plant dry matter carbon isotopic composition (yielding around 5{\texttenthousand}). From our model we estimate that, on a global basis, 21{\%} of GPP is by C4 plants and for the terrestrial biosphere as a whole we calculate an average isotope discrimination during photosynthesis of 14.8{\texttenthousand}. There are large variations in $\Delta$A across the globe, the largest of which are associated with the precence or absence of C4 plants. Due to longitudinal variations in $\Delta$A, there are problems in using latitudinally averaged terrestrial carbon isotope discriminations to calculate the ratio of net oceanic to net terrestrial carbon fluxes.",

	abstract="Photosynthetic efficiency is often quantified as the light-limited, maximum quantum yield in ecophysiological studies. Four published comparative studies report that photosynthetic efficiency varies little among plant species of widely diverse origins, and that quantum yields were near the maximum theoretically attainable value. However, many other published studies contradict this conclusion, reporting quantum yields as low as 30{\%} of those found in the comparative studies. These studies have created the impression that certain plants, particularly wild plants growing outdoors, may have intrinsically low photosynthetic efficiencies. To investigate the validity of these differing interpretations, we compiled quantum yield data from a survey of 30 published studies and compared those with data from the two most comprehensive comparative quantum yield studies. We also included quantum yield observations that we made on ten species. While our data confirm the results of the comparative studies indicating that maximum quantum yield is high and invariant, the literature survey data showed a wide range of quantum yield values. To investigate whether low quantum yield values could be caused by data collection and analysis techniques, we analyzed photosynthetic light-response data. Substantial underestimation of quantum yield could result from including in the calculation data extending beyond the linear region of the photosynthetic light response. In some cases quantum yield measurements can be influenced by changing levels of intercellular CO2 during measurements. We conclude that many quantum yield values reported in the literature are affected by one or more of these errors, and the intrinsic efficiency of photosynthesis is mostly invariant among C3 plants. This emphasizes the importance of the measurement and data analysis protocols in obtaining accurate and reliable quantum yield data.",

	abstract = {Abstract. Climate change will include correlated increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca). Rising temperatures will increase the ratio of photorespiratory loss of carbon to photosynthetic gain, whilst rising Ca will have an opposing effect. The mechanism of these effects at the level of carboxylation in C3 photosynthesis are quantitatively well understood and provide a basis for models of the response of leaf and canopy carbon exchange to climate change. The principles of such a model are referred to here and used to quantitatively examine the implications of concurrent increase in temperature and Ca. Simulations of leaf photosynthesis show the increase, with elevation of Ca from 350 to 650 μmol mol-1, in light saturated rates of CO2 uptake (Asat) and maximum quantum yields (φ) to rise with temperature. An increase in Ca from 350 to 650 μmol mol-1 can increase Asat by 20\% at 10°C and by 105\% at 35°C, and can raise the temperature optimum of Asat by 5°C. This pattern of change agrees closely with experimental data. At the canopy level, simulations also suggest a strong interaction of increased temperature and CO2 concentration. Predictions are compared with the findings of long-term field studies. The principles used here suggest that elevated Ca will alter both the magnitude of the response of leaf and canopy carbon gain to rising temperature, and sometimes, the direction of response. Findings question the value of models for predicting plant production in response to climate change which ignore the direct effects of rising Ca and the modifications that rising Ca imposes on the temperature response of net CO2 exchange.},

	title = "Separation of net ecosystem exchange into assimilation and respiration using a light response curve approach: critical issues and global evaluation",
	abstract = "The measured net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between the ecosystem and the atmosphere reflects the balance between gross CO2 assimilation [gross primary production (GPP)] and ecosystem respiration (R-eco). For understanding the mechanistic responses of ecosystem processes to environmental change it is important to separate these two flux components. Two approaches are conventionally used: (1) respiration measurements made at night are extrapolated to the daytime or (2) light-response curves are fit to daytime NEE measurements and respiration is estimated from the intercept of the ordinate, which avoids the use of potentially problematic nighttime data. We demonstrate that this approach is subject to biases if the effect of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) modifying the light response is not included. We introduce an algorithm for NEE partitioning that uses a hyperbolic light response curve fit to daytime NEE, modified to account for the temperature sensitivity of respiration and the VPD limitation of photosynthesis. Including the VPD dependency strongly improved the model's ability to reproduce the asymmetric diurnal cycle during periods with high VPD, and enhances the reliability of R-eco estimates given that the reduction of GPP by VPD may be otherwise incorrectly attributed to higher R-eco. Results from this improved algorithm are compared against estimates based on the conventional nighttime approach. The comparison demonstrates that the uncertainty arising from systematic errors dominates the overall uncertainty of annual sums (median absolute deviation of GPP: 47 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), while errors arising from the random error (median absolute deviation: similar to 2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) are negligible. Despite site-specific differences between the methods, overall patterns remain robust, adding confidence to statistical studies based on the FLUXNET database. In particular, we show that the strong correlation between GPP and R-eco is not spurious but holds true when quasi-independent, i.e. daytime and nighttime based estimates are compared.",

	 abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton-Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML-or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

We altered the capacity of leaves to fix carbon by various means, and found invariably that the diffusive conductance of the epidermis to CO2 transfer, g, (which mainly depends on the number and dimensions of the stomata) changes in nearly the same proportion as the rate of assimilation of CO2. Thus, the intercellular concentration of CO2 (ci), calculated as ci = ca-A/g (where ca is ambient concentration of CO2, A is assimilation rate of CO2), tends to remain constant providing ca is kept constant. We used routine techniques1 to measure A and estimate g in leaves placed singly in chambers. Conductance takes account of CO2 transfer through both stomata and leaf boundary layer, the conductance of the latter being 0.5 mol m-2 s-1.},

The ratio of these quantities represents ecosystem water use efficiency. Its multiplication with mean daylight vapor pressure deficit (VPD) leads to a quantity which we call “inherent water use efficiency” (IWUE*). The dependence of IWUE* on environmental conditions indicates possible adaptive adjustment of ecosystem physiology in response to a changing environment. IWUE* is analyzed for 43 sites across a range of plant functional types and climatic conditions. IWUE* increases during short-term moderate drought conditions. Mean annual IWUE* varied by a factor of 3 among all sites. This is partly explained by soil moisture at field capacity, particularly in deciduous broad-leaved forests. Canopy light interception sets the upper limits to canopy photosynthesis, and explains half the variance in annual IWUE* among herbaceous ecosystems and evergreen needle-leaved forests. Knowledge of IWUE* offers valuable improvement to the representation of carbon and water coupling in ecosystem process models.},

	title = "Convergence in the temperature response of leaf respiration across biomes and plant functional types",
	abstract = "Plant respiration constitutes a massive carbon flux to the atmosphere, and a major control on the evolution of the global carbon cycle. It therefore has the potential to modulate levels of climate change due to the human burning of fossil fuels. Neither current physiological nor terrestrial biosphere models adequately describe its short-term temperature response, and even minor differences in the shape of the response curve can significantly impact estimates of ecosystem carbon release and/or storage. Given this, it is critical to establish whether there are predictable patterns in the shape of the respiration-temperature response curve, and thus in the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of respiration across the globe. Analyzing measurements in a comprehensive database for 231 species spanning 7 biomes, we demonstrate that temperature-dependent increases in leaf respiration do not follow a commonly used exponential function. Instead,we find a decelerating function as leaves warm, reflecting a declining sensitivity to higher temperatures that is remarkably uniform across all biomes and plant functional types. Such convergence in the temperature sensitivity of leaf respiration suggests that there are universally applicable controls on the temperature response of plant energy metabolism, such that a single new function can predict the temperature dependence of leaf respiration for global vegetation. This simple function enables straightforward description of plant respiration in the land-surface components of coupled earth system models. Our cross-biome analyses shows significant implications for such fluxes in cold climates, generally projecting lower values compared with previous estimates.",

	abstract = {Summary Leaf dark respiration (Rdark) is an important yet poorly quantified component of the global carbon cycle. Given this, we analyzed a new global database of Rdark and associated leaf traits. Data for 899 species were compiled from 100 sites (from the Arctic to the tropics). Several woody and nonwoody plant functional types (PFTs) were represented. Mixed-effects models were used to disentangle sources of variation in Rdark. Area-based Rdark at the prevailing average daily growth temperature (T) of each site increased only twofold from the Arctic to the tropics, despite a 20°C increase in growing T (8–28°C). By contrast, Rdark at a standard T (25°C, Rdark25) was threefold higher in the Arctic than in the tropics, and twofold higher at arid than at mesic sites. Species and PFTs at cold sites exhibited higher Rdark25 at a given photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax25) or leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]) than species at warmer sites. Rdark25 values at any given Vcmax25 or [N] were higher in herbs than in woody plants. The results highlight variation in Rdark among species and across global gradients in T and aridity. In addition to their ecological significance, the results provide a framework for improving representation of Rdark in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) and associated land-surface components of Earth system models (ESMs).},

  abstract = {Abstract: In microeconomics, a standard framework is used for determining the optimal input mix for a two‐input production process. Here we adapt this framework for understanding the way plants use water and nitrogen (N) in photosynthesis. The least‐cost input mixture for generating a given output depends on the relative cost of procuring and using nitrogen versus water. This way of considering the issue integrates concepts such as water‐use efficiency and photosynthetic nitrogen‐use efficiency into the more inclusive objective of optimizing the input mix for a given situation. We explore the implications of deploying alternative combinations of leaf nitrogen concentration and stomatal conductance to water, focusing on comparing hypothetical species occurring in low‐ versus high‐humidity habitats. We then present data from sites in both the United States and Australia and show that low‐rainfall species operate with substantially higher leaf N concentration per unit leaf area. The extra protein reflected in higher leaf N concentration is associated with a greater drawdown of internal CO2, such that low‐rainfall species achieve higher photosynthetic rates at a given stomatal conductance. This restraint of transpirational water use apparently counterbalances the multiple costs of deploying high‐nitrogen leaves.}

	ABSTRACT = {The latest MODIS GPP (gross primary productivity) product, MOD17A2H, has great advantages over the previous version, MOD17A2, because the resolution increased from 1000 m to 500 m. In this study, MOD17A2H GPP was assessed using the latest eddy covariance (EC) flux data (FLUXNET2015 Dataset) at eighteen sites in six ecosystems across the globe. The sensitivity of MOD17A2H GPP to the meteorology dataset and the fractional photosynthetically- active radiation (FPAR) product was explored by introducing site meteorology observations and improved Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) products. The results showed that MOD17A2H GPP underestimated flux-derived GPP at most sites. Its performance in estimating annual GPP was poor (R2 = 0.62) and even worse over eight days (R2 = 0.52). For the MOD17A2H algorithm, replacing the reanalysis meteorological datasets with the site meteorological measurements failed to improve the estimation accuracies. However, great improvements in estimating the site-based GPP were gained by replacing MODIS FPAR with GLASS FPAR. This indicated that in the existing MOD17A2H product, the errors were originated more from FPAR than the meteorological data. We further examined the potential error contributions from land cover classification and maximum light use efficiency (εmax). It was found that the current land cover classification scheme exhibited frequent misclassification errors. Moreover, the εmax value assigned in MOD17A2H was much smaller than the inferred εmax value. Therefore, the qualities of FPAR and land cover classification datasets should be upgraded, and the εmax value needs to be adjusted to provide more accurate GPP estimates using MOD17A2H for global ecosystems.},

Drought responses are hard to anticipate because canopy transpiration and diffusive conductance (G) respond to drying soil and vapor pressure deficit (D) in complex ways. A growing database of hydraulic traits, combined with a parsimonious theory of tree water transport and its regulation, may improve predictions of at-risk vegetation. The theory uses the physics of flow through soil and xylem to quantify how canopy water supply declines with drought and ceases by hydraulic failure. This transpiration ‘supply function’ is used to predict a water ‘loss function’ by assuming that stomatal regulation exploits transport capacity while avoiding failure. Supply–loss theory incorporates root distribution, hydraulic redistribution, cavitation vulnerability, and cavitation reversal. The theory efficiently defines stomatal responses to D, drying soil, and hydraulic vulnerability. Driving the theory with climate predicts drought-induced loss of plant hydraulic conductance (k), canopy G, carbon assimilation, and productivity. Data lead to the ‘chronic stress hypothesis’ wherein > 60\% loss of k increases mortality by multiple mechanisms. Supply–loss theory predicts the climatic conditions that push vegetation over this risk threshold. The theory's simplicity and predictive power encourage testing and application in large-scale modeling.},

	abstract = {The global land surface absorbs about a third of anthropogenic emissions each year, due to the difference between two key processes: ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Despite the importance of these two processes, it is not possible to measure either at the ecosystem scale during the daytime. Eddy-covariance measurements are widely used as the closest 'quasi-direct' ecosystem-scale observation from which to estimate ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Recent research, however, suggests that current estimates may be biased by up to 25\%, due to a previously unaccounted for process: the inhibition of leaf respiration in the light. Yet the extent of inhibition remains debated, and implications for estimates of ecosystem-scale respiration and photosynthesis remain unquantified. Here, we quantify an apparent inhibition of daytime ecosystem respiration across the global FLUXNET eddy-covariance network and identify a pervasive influence that varies by season and ecosystem type. We develop partitioning methods that can detect an apparent ecosystem-scale inhibition of daytime respiration and find that diurnal patterns of ecosystem respiration might be markedly different than previously thought. The results call for the re-evaluation of global terrestrial carbon cycle models and also suggest that current global estimates of photosynthesis and respiration may be biased, some on the order of magnitude of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Plant rooting depth (Zr) is a key parameter in hydrological and biogeochemical models, yet the global spatial distribution of Zr is largely unknown due to the difficulties in its direct measurement. Additionally, Zr observations are usually only representative of a single plant or several plants, which can differ greatly from the effective Zr over a modeling unit (e.g., catchment or grid-box). Here, we provide a global parameterization of an analytical Zr model that balances the marginal carbon cost and benefit of deeper roots, and produce a climatological (i.e., 1982–2010 average) global Zr map. To test the Zr estimates, we apply the estimated Zr in a highly transparent hydrological model (i.e., the Budyko-Choudhury-Porporato (BCP) model) to estimate mean annual actual evapotranspiration (E) across the globe. We then compare the estimated E with both water balance-based E observations at 32 major catchments and satellite grid-box retrievals across the globe. Our results show that the BCP model, when implemented with Zr estimated herein, optimally reproduced the spatial pattern of E at both scales (i.e., R2 = 0.94, RMSD = 74 mm yr−1 for catchments, and R2 = 0.90, RMSD = 125 mm yr−1 for grid-boxes) and provides improved model outputs when compared to BCP model results from two already existing global Zr data sets. These results suggest that our Zr estimates can be effectively used in state-of-the-art hydrological models, and potentially biogeochemical models, where the determination of Zr currently largely relies on biome type-based look-up tables.}

Earth system models are highly sensitive to this particular parameter with large consequences for modeled plant productivity, water{\textendash}energy{\textendash}carbon exchange between the land and the atmosphere, and silicate weathering regulating multimillion-year-timescale carbon cycle. However, we know little about how deep roots go and why. Accidental discoveries of \&gt;70-m-deep roots in wells and \&gt;20-m-deep roots in caves offer glimpses of the enormous plasticity of root response to its environment, but the drivers and the global significance of such deep roots are not clear. Through observations and modeling, we demonstrate that soil hydrology is a globally prevalent force driving landscape to global patterns of plant rooting depth.Plant rooting depth affects ecosystem resilience to environmental stress such as drought. Deep roots connect deep soil/groundwater to the atmosphere, thus influencing the hydrologic cycle and climate. Deep roots enhance bedrock weathering, thus regulating the long-term carbon cycle. However, we know little about how deep roots go and why. Here, we present a global synthesis of 2,200 root observations of \&gt;1,000 species along biotic (life form, genus) and abiotic (precipitation, soil, drainage) gradients. Results reveal strong sensitivities of rooting depth to local soil water profiles determined by precipitation infiltration depth from the top (reflecting climate and soil), and groundwater table depth from below (reflecting topography-driven land drainage). In well-drained uplands, rooting depth follows infiltration depth; in waterlogged lowlands, roots stay shallow, avoiding oxygen stress below the water table; in between, high productivity and drought can send roots many meters down to the groundwater capillary fringe. This framework explains the contrasting rooting depths observed under the same climate for the same species but at distinct topographic positions. We assess the global significance of these hydrologic mechanisms by estimating root water-uptake depths using an inverse model, based on observed productivity and atmosphere, at 30" (\~{}1-km) global grids to capture the topography critical to soil hydrology. The resulting patterns of plant rooting depth bear a strong topographic and hydrologic signature at landscape to global scales. They underscore a fundamental plant{\textendash}water feedback pathway that may be critical to understanding plant-mediated global change.},

ABSTRACT = {Remotely sensed vegetation indices (RSVIs) can be used to efficiently estimate terrestrial primary productivity across space and time. Terrestrial productivity, however, has many facets (e.g., spatial and temporal variability, including seasonality, interannual variability, and trends), and different vegetation indices may not be equally good at predicting them. Their accuracy in monitoring productivity has been mostly tested in single-ecosystem studies, but their performance in different ecosystems distributed over large areas still needs to be fully explored. To fill this gap, we identified the facets of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) that could be monitored using RSVIs. We compared the temporal and spatial patterns of four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRV, and CCI), derived from the MODIS MAIAC data set and of GPP derived from data from 58 eddy-flux towers in eight ecosystems with different plant functional types (evergreen needle-leaved forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, open shrubland, grassland, cropland, and wetland) distributed throughout Europe, covering Mediterranean, temperate, and boreal regions. The RSVIs monitored temporal variability well in most of the ecosystem types, with grasslands and evergreen broad-leaved forests most strongly and weakly correlated with weekly and monthly RSVI data, respectively. The performance of the RSVIs monitoring temporal variability decreased sharply, however, when the seasonal component of the time series was removed, suggesting that the seasonal cycles of both the GPP and RSVI time series were the dominant drivers of their relationships. Removing winter values from the analyses did not affect the results. NDVI and CCI identified the spatial variability of average annual GPP, and all RSVIs identified GPP seasonality well. The RSVI estimates, however, could not estimate the interannual variability of GPP across sites or monitor the trends of GPP. Overall, our results indicate that RSVIs are suitable to track different facets of GPP variability at the local scale, therefore they are reliable sources of GPP monitoring at larger geographical scales.},

abstract={Satellite retrievals of information about the Earth's surface are widely used to monitor global terrestrial photosynthesis and primary production and to examine the ecological impacts of droughts. Methods for estimating photosynthesis from space commonly combine information on vegetation greenness, incoming radiation, temperature and atmospheric demand for water (vapour-pressure deficit), but do not account for the direct effects of low soil moisture. They instead rely on vapour-pressure deficit as a proxy for dryness, despite widespread evidence that soil moisture deficits have a direct impact on vegetation, independent of vapour-pressure deficit. Here, we use a globally distributed measurement network to assess the effect of soil moisture on photosynthesis, and identify a common bias in an ensemble of satellite-based estimates of photosynthesis that is governed by the magnitude of soil moisture effects on photosynthetic light-use efficiency. We develop methods to account for the influence of soil moisture and estimate that soil moisture effects reduce global annual photosynthesis by {\textasciitilde}15\%, increase interannual variability by more than 100\% across 25\% of the global vegetated land surface, and amplify the impacts of extreme events on primary production. These results demonstrate the importance of soil moisture effects for monitoring carbon-cycle variability and drought impacts on vegetation productivity from space.},

              to the atmosphere, models must replicate the responses of plants
              to environmental changes. Several processes, operating at various
              scales, cause the responses of photosynthesis and plant
              respiration to temperature and CO2 to change over time of
              exposure to new or changing environmental conditions. Here, we
              review the latest empirical evidence that short-term responses of
              plant carbon exchange rates to temperature and CO2 are modified
              by plant photosynthetic and respiratory acclimation as well as
              biogeochemical feedbacks. We assess the frequency with which
              these responses have been incorporated into vegetation models,
              and highlight recently designed algorithms that can facilitate
              their incorporation. Few models currently include representations
              of the long-term plant responses that have been recorded by
              empirical studies, likely because these responses are still
              poorly understood at scales relevant for models. Studies show
              that, at a regional scale, simulated carbon flux between the

              However, the realism of these results is difficult to evaluate,

The maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco, commonly termed Vc,max, is a key parameter in the FvCB model. This study investigated the derivation of the values of Vc,max used to represent different plant functional types (PFTs) in ESMs. Four methods for estimating Vc,max were identified; (1) an empirical or (2) mechanistic relationship was used to relate Vc,max to leaf N content, (3) Vc,max was estimated using an approach based on the optimization of photosynthesis and respiration or (4) calibration of a user-defined Vc,max to obtain a target model output. Despite representing the same PFTs, the land model components of ESMs were parameterized with a wide range of values for Vc,max (−46 to +77 {\%} of the PFT mean). In many cases, parameterization was based on limited data sets and poorly defined coefficients that were used to adjust model parameters and set PFT-specific values for Vc,max. Examination of the models that linked leaf N mechanistically to Vc,max identified potential changes to fixed parameters that collectively would decrease Vc,max by 31 {\%} in C3 plants and 11 {\%} in C4 plants. Plant trait data bases are now available that offer an excellent opportunity for models to update PFT-specific parameters used to estimate Vc,max. However, data for parameterizing some PFTs, particularly those in the Tropics and the Arctic are either highly variable or largely absent.",

               applicable formula for the relationship between sensible and

               evaporation rate is given by the same formula for evaporation

              the eighth leaf blades of rice from emergence to senescence.
              Synthesis of Rubisco was very active during leaf expansion,
              became quite low at the time of full expansion and then declined
              further during senescence. The changes in the levels of rbcL and
              rbcS mRNAs co-ordinated approximately with those in the amount of
              Rubisco synthesized. Thus, it is suggested that the amount of
              Rubisco synthesized is determined primarily by the levels of rbcL
              and rbcS mRNAs during the life span of the leaves. Degradation of
              Rubisco started just before the time of full expansion and became

              earlier in the developmental stage and proceeded at a much faster

               necessary input in several crop growth models. Previous research
               from several locations with different instruments has suggested
               that PAR could be estimated as a constant fraction of shortwave
               radiation. This study was conducted to determine if a simple
               relationship was valid for a large geographic area in the
               western half of the USA. In the semiarid climate near Fresno,
               CA, the daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in units
               of µmol m-2 was 2.04 $\pm$ 0.06 times the solar irradiance (SI).
               The daily irradiance within the PAR waveband (photosynthetic
               irradiance (PI), 0.4 to 0.7 µm) was estimated to be 45\% of the
               daily solar irradiance. The diurnal pattern of these
               relationships was consistent with measurements at Phoenix, AZ
               and exhibited only a slight diurnal variation. Independent
               measurements of the solar irradiance between 0.285 and 0.63 µm
               with ``filtered'' pyranometers at the Fresno site indicated that
               irradiance between 0.285 and 0.63 pm was 41\% of solar
               irradiance, a result which was about 7\% lower than the estimate
               from the PAR/SI value converted with a published sun and sky
               PAR/PI factor. This difference was largely attributed to the
               differences in measured wavebands. Measurements of solar
               irradiance less than the waveband of 0.63 µm and total solar
               irradiance obtained with the same equipment at Brawley, CA;

               MN; Fargo, ND; Sidney, MT; Beartooth Pass, WY; Kimberly, ID;
               Davis, CA were similar to those measured at Fresno, CA. The
               results indicate that PAR can be estimated from solar irradiance
               measurements to within 10\% (which is probably acceptable for
               most plant growth models) throughout most of the Western USA.",

              stimulated by climate warming, comparing results across studies
              requires consistent terminology. We identify five types of
              photosynthetic adjustments in warming experiments: photosynthesis
              as measured at the high growth temperature, the growth
              temperature, and the thermal optimum; the photosynthetic thermal
              optimum; and leaf-level photosynthetic capacity. Adjustments of
              any one of these variables need not mean a concurrent adjustment
              in others, which may resolve apparently contradictory results in
              papers using different indicators of photosynthetic acclimation.
              We argue that photosynthetic thermal acclimation (i.e., that
              benefits a plant in its new growth environment) should include
              adjustments of both the photosynthetic thermal optimum (T opt)
              and photosynthetic rates at the growth temperature (A growth), a
              combination termed constructive adjustment. However, many species
              show reduced photosynthesis when grown at elevated temperatures,
              despite adjustment of some photosynthetic variables, a phenomenon
              we term detractive adjustment. An analysis of 70 studies on 103
              species shows that adjustment of T opt and A growth are more
              common than adjustment of other photosynthetic variables, but
              only half of the data demonstrate constructive adjustment. No
              systematic differences in these patterns were found between
              different plant functional groups. We also discuss the importance
              of thermal acclimation of respiration for net photosynthesis
              measurements, as respiratory temperature acclimation can generate
              apparent acclimation of photosynthetic processes, even if
              photosynthesis is unaltered. We show that while dark respiration
              is often used to estimate light respiration, the ratio of light

              of electron transport (Jmax ), the maximum rate of

              C4 ), and climate of origin (tropical and nontropical) grown
              under fertilized, well-watered conditions. In general,
              acclimation to warmer temperatures increased the rate of each
              process. The relative increase in different photosynthetic
              processes varied by plant type, with C3 species tending to

              assimilation, which differ by plant type. The acclimation

              temperature optima approximately 14°C higher than cool grown
              (20/15°C) plants (Monson, Littlejohn \& Williams, 1983). The

              determining photo-synthetic temperature optima as a function of
              time, of cool grown plants moved to warm growing conditions.
              Leaves which had developed under cool conditions were capable of
              an upward adjustment of 6?8°C of their optimum photosynthetic

  abstract  = "Abstract. Land-surface models (LSMs) are increasingly called
               upon to represent not only the exchanges of energy, water and
               momentum across the land--atmosphere interface (their original
               purpose in climate models), but also how ecosystems and water
               resources respond to climate, atmospheric environment, land-use
               and land-use change, and how these responses in turn influence
               land--atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), trace gases and
               other species that affect the composition and chemistry of the
               atmosphere. However, the LSMs embedded in state-of-the-art
               climate models differ in how they represent fundamental aspects
               of the hydrological and carbon cycles, resulting in large
               inter-model differences and sometimes faulty predictions. These
               ``third-generation'' LSMs respect the close coupling of the
               carbon and water cycles through plants, but otherwise tend to be
               under-constrained, and have not taken full advantage of robust
               hydrological parameterizations that were independently developed
               in offline models. Benchmarking, combining multiple sources of
               atmospheric, biospheric and hydrological data, should be a
               required component of LSM development, but this field has been
               relatively poorly supported and intermittently pursued.
               Moreover, benchmarking alone is not sufficient to ensure that
               models improve. Increasing complexity may increase realism but
               decrease reliability and robustness, by increasing the number of
               poorly known model parameters. In contrast, simplifying the
               representation of complex processes by stochastic
               parameterization (the representation of unresolved processes by
               statistical distributions of values) has been shown to improve
               model reliability and realism in both atmospheric and
               land-surface modelling contexts. We provide examples for
               important processes in hydrology (the generation of runoff and
               flow routing in heterogeneous catchments) and biology (carbon
               uptake by species-diverse ecosystems). We propose that the way

               representations of biological and hydrological processes based
               on the implementation of multiple internal constraints; (b)

              productivity (NPP) to absorbed photosynthetically active
              radiation (APAR), is approximately constant with respect to
              changes in APAR, implies that NPP can be modeled using a linear
              relationship with APAR. However, such a linear relationship is
              counter-intuitive because the relationship between leaf
              photosynthesis and absorbed light is strongly nonlinear. Three
              arguments have been advanced to explain the observed linear
              relationship between NPP and APAR. In this paper, a detailed,
              physiologically based model of canopy radiation absorption and
              photosynthesis (MAESTRO) was used to analyze these arguments. The
              first argument is that the canopy is structured so that radiation
              is distributed throughout the canopy such that most leaves are
              exposed to non-saturating quantum flux density, resulting in a
              linear response of canopy photosynthesis to APAR. Simulations of
              MAESTRO indicated that this explanation is inadequate, because
              daily values of canopy photosynthetic light use efficiency
              calculated with MAESTRO were highly variable regardless of canopy
              structure. The second argument is that variability in light use
              efficiency decreases with increasing time scale. The simulations
              showed that this is true to some extent, although simulated
              annual canopy photosynthetic light use efficiency still varies
              across sites with different LAI or light climate. The third

              clear annual cycle of photosynthetic activity. A recent study
              demonstrated that the seasonal variation in photosynthetic
              capacity of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) could be attributed
              mainly to the light response curve of photosynthesis. The
              magnitude of the light response curve varied over the season
              while its shape remained constant, indicating that the two
              physiological parameters quantifying the curve-the quantum yield
              per unit internal carbon dioxide concentration and the
              corresponding light-saturated rate-remained proportional to each
              other. We now show, through modeling studies, that the quantum
              yield (and hence the light-saturated rate) is related to the
              annual cycle of temperature through a delayed dynamic response.
              The proposed model was tested by comparing model results with
              intensive measurements of photosynthesis and driving variables
              made from April to October in three shoots of Scots pine growing
              near the northern timberline. Photosynthetic capacity showed
              considerable acclimation during the growing season. A single
              model describing photosynthetic capacity as a reversible,

  abstract = "The process-based growth model, BIOMASS, was modified to
              incorporate low-temperature effects on photosynthetic production
              in Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands growing in northern Sweden.
              The low-temperature features incorporated in BIOMASS made it
              possible to simulate and estimate the reduction in photosynthetic
              rates caused by boreal conditions. The following four
              simulation-scenarios were used: (i) `potential' photosynthesis
              without boreal restrictions; (ii) reduction caused by a frozen
              soil; (iii) reduction caused by incomplete recovery of
              photosynthetic capacity during spring as a result of damage
              caused by low winter temperatures; and (iv) reduction as an
              effect of frost-induced autumn decline. Annual photosynthetic
              production (or gross primary production (GPP)) was simulated for
              three calendar years, 1990--1992, for stands with low (control)
              and high (irrigated and fertilized) nutrient availability. The
              reduction of `potential' GPP, caused by the low-temperature
              effects, ranged from 35--44\% for control (C) and from 34--42\%
              for irrigated-fertilised (IL) stands, respectively. The most
              pronounced loss of `potential' GPP originated from reduced
              photosynthetic capacity, in spring and early summer, which led to
              losses of 21--28\% for C and 19--26\% for IL stands. The
              variation between years differed mainly as an effect of
              differences in spring temperatures, which resulted in different
              rates of recovery of photosynthetic capacity. Reductions caused
              by frozen soil and low photosynthetic capacity during winter were
              similar in C and IL stands (12--13\%), as were the losses
              resulting from severe autumn frosts (3--4\%). It is concluded
              that, unless the effects of frozen soils and reduced
              photosynthetic capacity during spring and early summer are
              considered, large errors (ca. 40\%) will be introduced into

              and low temperature, conditions which are potentially
              photoinhibitory. The photosynthetic response of plants to low
              temperature is dependent upon time of exposure and the
              developmental history of the leaves. Exposure of fully expanded
              leaves of winter cereals to short-term, low temperature
              shiftsinhibits whereas low temperature growthstimulates electron
              transport capacity and carbon assimilation. However, the
              photosynthetic response to low temperature is clearly species and
              cultivar dependent. Winter annuals and algae which actively grow
              and develop at low temperature and moderate irradiance acquire a
              resistance to irradiance 5- to 6-fold higher than their growth
              irradiance. Resistance to short-term photoinhibition (hours) in
              winter cereals is a reflection of the increased capacity to keep
              QA oxidized under high light conditions and low temperature. This
              is due to an increased capacity for photosynthesis. These
              characteristics reflect photosynthetic acclimation to low growth
              temperature and can be used to predict the freezing tolerance of
              cereals. It is proposed that the enhanced photosynthetic capacity
              reflects an increased flux of fixed carbon through to sucrose in
              source tissue as a consequence of the combined effects of
              increased storage of carbohydrate as fructans in the vacuole of
              leaf mesophyll cells and an enhanced export to the crown due to
              its increased sink activity. Long-term exposure (months) of
              cereals to low temperature photoinhibition indicates that this
              reduction of photochemical efficiency of PS II represents a
              stable, long-term down regulation of PS II to match the energy
              requirements for CO2 fixation. Thus, photoinhibition in vivo
              should be viewed as the capacity of plants to adjust
              photosynthetically to the prevailing environmental conditions
              rather than a process which necessarily results in damage or
              injury to plants. Not all cold tolerant, herbaceous annuals use
              the same mechanism to acquire resistance to photoinhibition. In
              contrast to annuals and algae, overwintering evergreens become
              dormant during the cold hardening period and generally remain
              susceptible to photoinhibition. It is concluded that the
              photosynthetic response to low temperatures and susceptibility to
              photoinhibition are consequences of the overwintering strategy of
              the plant species.",

              withstand a cold winter and the stochastic occurrence of freeze
              events during any time of the year. The physiological mechanisms
              trees adopt to escape, avoid, and tolerate freezing temperatures
              include a cold acclimation in autumn, a dormancy period during
              winter (leafless in deciduous trees), and the maintenance of a
              certain freezing tolerance during dehardening in early spring.
              The change from one phase to the next is mediated by complex
              interactions between temperature and photoperiod. This review
              aims at providing an overview of the interplay between phenology

              relationship between satellite-observed SIF and gridded GPP
              products both based on coarse spatial resolutions. Finer
              resolution SIF (1.3 km $\times$ 2.25 km) measured from the
              Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) provides the first
              opportunity to examine the SIF-GPP relationship at the ecosystem
              scale using flux tower GPP data. However, it remains unclear how
              strong the relationship is for each biome and whether a robust,
              universal relationship exists across a variety of biomes. Here we
              conducted the first global analysis of the relationship between
              OCO-2 SIF and tower GPP for a total of 64 flux sites across the
              globe encompassing eight major biomes. OCO-2 SIF showed strong
              correlations with tower GPP at both midday and daily timescales,
              with the strongest relationship observed for daily SIF at the 757
              nm (R2 = 0.72, p < 0.0001). Strong linear relationships between
              SIF and GPP were consistently found for all biomes (R2 =
              0.57-0.79, p < 0.0001) except evergreen broadleaf forests (R2 =
              0.16, p < 0.05) at the daily timescale. A higher slope was found
              for C4 grasslands and croplands than for C3 ecosystems. The
              generally consistent slope of the relationship among biomes
              suggests a nearly universal rather than biome-specific SIF-GPP
              relationship, and this finding is an important distinction and
              simplification compared to previous results. SIF was mainly
              driven by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and was
              also influenced by environmental stresses (temperature and water
              stresses) that determine photosynthetic light use efficiency.
              OCO-2 SIF generally had a better performance for predicting GPP
              than satellite-derived vegetation indices and a light use
              efficiency model. The universal SIF-GPP relationship can
              potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates regionally or
              globally. Our findings revealed the remarkable ability of finer
              resolution SIF observations from OCO-2 and other new or future
              missions (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX) for estimating terrestrial

              photosynthesis during sunny warm days in winter. Using thermal
              imagery, we found that foliage in winter was sometimes near the
              temperature optimum for photosynthesis, but no net carbon gain
              occurred for most of the cold season. Water transport was limited
              by blockage of sap transport by frozen boles, but not by frozen
              soils. Foliar carotenoid content was much higher during winter,
              driven largely by increases in the pool size of the

              responses of photosynthesis to cold and the winter behavior of
              photosynthesis in conifers. Photosynthetic acclimation is
              discussed in terms of the requirement for a balance between the
              energy absorbed through largely temperature-insensitive
              photochemical processes and the energy used for
              temperature-sensitive biochemical processes and growth. Cold
              acclimation transforms the xanthophyll-mediated nonphotochemical
              antenna quenching of absorbed light from a short-term dynamic
              response to a long-term sustained quenching for the whole winter
              period. This acclimative response helps protect the evergreen
              foliage from photooxidative damage during the winter when
              photosynthesis is restricted or prevented by low temperatures.
              Although the molecular mechanisms behind the sustained winter
              excitation quenching are largely unknown, it does involve major
              alterations in the organization and composition of the
              photosystem II antenna. In addition, photosystem I may play an
              important role in overwintering evergreens not only by quenching
              absorbed light photochemically via its support of cyclic electron
              transport at low temperatures, but also by nonphotochemical
              quenching of absorbed light irrespective of temperature. The
              possible role of photosystem II reaction centers in
              nonphotochemical quenching of absorbed energy in overwintering
              evergreens is also discussed. Processes like chlororespiration

  abstract = "Summary Evergreens are faced with the challenge, during winter,
              of low temperatures in combination with light exposure, resulting
              in an imbalance between light absorption and its utilization via
              photosynthetic carbon reduction. To cope with excess light,
              evergreens increase their use of thermal energy dissipation,
              which occurs in a sustained form during winter. There are two
              forms of sustained thermal dissipation that occur in
              winter-stressed evergreens, characterized by their rate of
              reversal upon warming. A rapid form reverses within minutes to
              hours upon warming, while a slower form reverses over the course
              of days. The light environment and the severity of winter
              conditions both play a role in determining the relative amount of
              each type of sustained energy dissipation throughout the winter.
              It is suggested that the two forms of sustained dissipation
              observed in winter-stressed evergreens correspond to sustained
              forms of the two mechanisms of thermal energy dissipation
              proposed by Holzwarth and colleagues, with the rapidly reversible
              component corresponding to a sustained form of the
              energy-dependent form of thermal energy dissipation (qE) and the
              slowly reversible component corresponding to a sustained form of
              the zeaxanthin-dependent mechanism (qZ). Additional outstanding
              questions and future directions are discussed.",

  abstract = "The forward and reverse rate constants involved in carbamylation,
              activation, carboxylation, and inhibition of
              D-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) have
              been estimated by a new technique of simultaneous non-linear
              regression of a differential equation kinetic model to multiple
              experimental data. Parameters predicted by the model fitted to
              data from purified spinach enzyme in vitro included binding
              affinity constants for non-substrate CO2 and Mg2+ of 200+/-80
              microM and 700+/-200 microM, respectively, as well as a turnover
              number (k(cat)) of 3.3+/-0.5 s(-1), a Michaelis half-saturation
              constant for carboxylation (K(M,C)) of 10+/-4 microM and a
              Michaelis constant for RuBP binding (K(M,RuBP)) of 1.5+/-0.5
              microM. These and other constants agree well with previously
              measured values where they exist. The model is then used to show
              that slow inactivation of RuBisCO (fallover) in oxygen-free
              conditions at low concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+ is due to
              decarbamylation and binding of RuBP to uncarbamylated enzyme. In
              spite of RuBP binding more tightly to uncarbamylated enzyme than
              to the activated form, RuBisCO is activated at high
              concentrations of CO2 and Mg2+. This apparent paradox is resolved
              by considering activation kinetics and the fact that while RuBP
              binds tightly but slowly to uncarbamylated enzyme, it binds fast
              and loosely to activated enzyme. This modelling technique is
              presented as a new method for determining multiple kinetic data
              simultaneously from a limited experimental data set. The method
              can be used to compare the properties of RuBisCO from different
              species quickly and easily.",

	ABSTRACT = {Long-term global data sets of vegetation Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) are critical to monitoring global vegetation dynamics and for modeling exchanges of energy, mass and momentum between the land surface and planetary boundary layer. LAI and FPAR are also state variables in hydrological, ecological, biogeochemical and crop-yield models. The generation, evaluation and an example case study documenting the utility of 30-year long data sets of LAI and FPAR are described in this article. A neural network algorithm was first developed between the new improved third generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI3g) and  best-quality Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI and FPAR products for the overlapping period 2000–2009. The trained neural network algorithm was then used to generate corresponding LAI3g and FPAR3g data sets with the following attributes: 15-day temporal frequency, 1/12 degree spatial resolution and temporal span of July 1981 to December 2011. The quality of these data sets for scientific research in other disciplines was assessed through (a) comparisons with field measurements scaled to the spatial resolution of the data products, (b) comparisons with broadly-used existing alternate satellite data-based products, (c) comparisons to plant growth limiting climatic variables in the northern latitudes and tropical regions, and  (d) correlations of dominant modes of interannual variability with large-scale circulation anomalies such as the EI Niño-Southern Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation. These assessment efforts yielded results that attested to the suitability of these data sets for research use in other disciplines. The utility of these data sets is documented by comparing the seasonal profiles of LAI3g with profiles from 18 state-of-the-art Earth System Models: the models consistently overestimated the satellite-based estimates of leaf area and simulated delayed peak seasonal values in the northern latitudes, a result that is consistent with previous evaluations of similar models with ground-based data. The LAI3g and FPAR3g data sets can be obtained freely from the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) website.},

	abstract = {Our ability to close the Earth's carbon budget and predict feedbacks in a warming climate depends critically on knowing where, when and how carbon dioxide is exchanged between the land and atmosphere. Terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) constitutes the largest flux component in the global carbon budget, however significant uncertainties remain in GPP estimates and its seasonality. Empirically, we show that global spaceborne observations of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence – occurring during photosynthesis – exhibit a strong linear correlation with GPP. We found that the fluorescence emission even without any additional climatic or model information has the same or better predictive skill in estimating GPP as those derived from traditional remotely-sensed vegetation indices using ancillary data and model assumptions. In boreal summer the generally strong linear correlation between fluorescence and GPP models weakens, attributable to discrepancies in savannas/croplands (18–48\% higher fluorescence-based GPP derived by simple linear scaling), and high-latitude needleleaf forests (28–32\% lower fluorescence). Our results demonstrate that retrievals of chlorophyll fluorescence provide direct global observational constraints for GPP and open an entirely new viewpoint on the global carbon cycle. We anticipate that global fluorescence data in combination with consolidated plant physiological fluorescence models will be a step-change in carbon cycle research and enable an unprecedented robustness in the understanding of the current and future carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {We propose the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS), an upscaling approach to quantify global gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration using MODIS with a spatial resolution of 1–5 km and a temporal resolution of 8 days. This effort is novel because it is the first system that harmonizes and utilizes MODIS Atmosphere and Land products on the same projection and spatial resolution over the global land. This enabled us to use the MODIS Atmosphere products to calculate atmospheric radiative transfer for visual and near infrared radiation wave bands. Then we coupled atmospheric and canopy radiative transfer processes, with models that computed leaf photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and transpiration on the sunlit and shaded portions of the vegetation and soil. At the annual time step, the mass and energy fluxes derived from BESS showed strong linear relations with measurements of solar irradiance (r2 = 0.95, relative bias: 8\%), gross primary productivity (r2 = 0.86, relative bias: 5\%) and evapotranspiration (r2 = 0.86, relative bias: 15\%) in data from 33 flux towers that cover seven plant functional types across arctic to tropical climatic zones. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration computed in BESS were most sensitive to leaf area index and solar irradiance, respectively. We quantified the mean global terrestrial estimates of gross primary productivity and evapotranpiration between 2001 and 2003 as 118 ± 26 PgC yr−1 and 500 ± 104 mm yr−1 (equivalent to 63,000 ± 13,100 km3 yr−1), respectively. BESS-derived gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration estimates were consistent with the estimates from independent machine-learning, data-driven products, but the process-oriented structure has the advantage of diagnosing sensitivity of mechanisms. The process-based BESS is able to offer gridded biophysical variables everywhere from local to the total global land scales with an 8-day interval over multiple years.},
